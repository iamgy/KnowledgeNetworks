Abstract = {{9-Deazaadenosine (DZA), one of the potent inhibitors of
   S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase, is known to possess several biological
   properties including an induction of apoptosis. To evaluate a
   possibility that DZA may be utilized for the treatment of human
   leukemia, we studied molecular events of cell death induced by DZA in
   human leukemia HL-60 and U-937 cells. DZA induced a specific cleavage of
   poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) and an activation of the cysteine
   protease caspase-3/CPP32 which is known to cleave PARP. DZA-mediated
   nuclear DNA-fragmentation was completely blocked in the presence of a
   universal inhibitor of caspases (z-VAD-fmk) or the specific inhibitor of
   caspase-3 (z-DEVD-fmk) unlike of cycloheximide (CHX). DNA fragmentation
   was preceded by the lowering of c-myc mRNA in the DZA treated cells. In
   addition, DZA-induced apoptosis was blocked by pretreatment with
   adenosine transporter inhibitors such as nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBTI)
   and dipyridamole (DPD). Taken together, these results demonstrate that
   DZA-Induced apoptosis initiated through an active transport of DZA into
   human leukemia cells, is dependent on the caspase-3-like activity
   without de nova synthesis of proteins and possibly involves c-myc
   down-regulation.}},

Abstract = {{The GA-binding protein (GABP) is a ubiquitous heteromeric transcription
   factor implicated in the regulation of several genes involved in
   mitochondrial energy metabolism including subunits of cytochrome c
   oxidase, ATP synthase, and mitochondrial transcription factor 1 (mtTF1).
   GABP alpha subunit binds the PEA3/Ets binding sites (EBS), while GABP
   beta contains a transcription activation domain and mediates alpha beta
   dimer and alpha (2)beta (2) tetramer formation essential for activation
   of transcription. Here we report the cloning of 2449 bp of the mouse (m)
   GABP alpha promoter region including 201 bp of the 5' end of the
   published mGABP alpha cDNA sequence. Surprisingly, sequences homologous
   to the 5'UTR of mouse, rat and human mitochondrial ATP synthase coupling
   factor 6 (ATPsynCF6) cDNAs were found165-240 bp upstream of the mGABP
   alpha cDNA. A search of the non-redundant nucleotide database revealed a
   human genomic sequence derived from chromosome 21 (21q22) bearing
   significant homology to the mGABP alpha /ATPsynCF6 promoter region and
   encompassed the entire hGABP alpha and hATP-synCF6 genes. Primer
   extension analysis revealed multiple transcription start sites for both
   mGABP alpha and mATPsynCF6 mRNAs that mapped near the published cDNA 5'
   ends. Sequence analysis identified several binding sites upstream of the
   GABP alpha cDNA sequence including sites for GABP (-86, -104, -169,
   -257, and -994), YY1 (-57), Spl (-242 and -226), and NRF1 (-5). No
   `TATA' motif was identified near either the GABPa or ATPsynCF6
   transcription start sites. The human and mouse promoters retain
   significant sequence identity including binding sites for several
   tissue-specific transcription factors. Transient transfection assays
   using Luciferase reporter constructs containing the intergenic region
   and flanking sequences confirmed that this region of DNA promotes
   transcription in both directions. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{The mammary gland has been found to express the gene encoding growth
   hormone (GH) in several species. Within the mammary gland, it may act as
   an autocrine paracrine growth factor for cyclic epithelial changes. and
   may be a determinant in mammary carcinogenrsis. In the dog, progestins
   enhance mammary GH expression. To elucidate the mechanism of
   progestin-induced mammary GH expression. the canine progestorone
   receptor (PR) is characterized and the cellular localization of the PR
   in normal and tumorous mammary tissues is examined. Sequence analysis of
   the canine PR revealed two in-frame ATG codons, encoding a putative PR-B
   protein of 939 amino acids and a putative PR-A protein of 765 amino
   acids. Western blot analysis indicated that both isoforms occur in
   uterus and mammary plant issues. Immunohistochemical analysis of the PR
   revealed that the PR was differentially expressed in mammary tissue.
   with many PR-positive epithelial cells in the proliferation phase of the
   glandular tissue and a low number of PR-positive cells in differentiated
   mammary tissue. Stromal and myoepithelial cells had no specific PR
   staining. Mammary tumours had a variety of staining patterns, including
   no staining. normal nuclear staining, marked heterogeneous
   immunoreactivity and perinuclear staining of tumorous epithelial cells
   and cytoplasmic-staining of spindle cells. Double staining showed that
   all GH-producing cells were positive for PR, whereas not all PR
   containing cells stained for GH. It is concluded that the activated PR
   may transactivate GH expression in the mammary gland within the same
   cell and functions as a pre-requisite transcription factor. However.
   during malignant transformation this regulation may be lost. (C) 2001

Abstract = {{Modification of transcription factors would result in significant
   changes in the expression of related genes. Recently, the presence of
   transglutaminase (TGase) has been reported in nuclei, the biological
   significances of which have attracted a great concern. In this study, we
   tested the possibility that nuclear TGase would crosslink and regulate
   the activity of a glutamine-rich transcription factor Sp1. The addition
   of purified guinea pig liver TGase increased the binding activity of Sp1
   to the target DNA sequence by gel electrophoretic mobility shift assay.
   The activity of the human p21(WAF1) promoter containing six Sp1 binding
   sites was increased by the cotransfection of the TGase 2 gene, and two
   Spl sites at -82 and -69, relative to the transcription start site, were
   essential for the increased activity in human renal embryonic 293T
   cells. The activity of a minimal promoter containing three consensus Sp1
   binding sites was increased by co-transfection of human TGase 2 gene.
   The amount of Sp1 protein was increased dramatically in TGase
   2-transfected 293T cells and the Sp1 protein itself from HeLa cell
   nuclear extracts was crosslinked readily by-purified TGase at 37
   degreesC in the presence of Ca2+. These results suggest that the nuclear
   TGase might modulate the activity of the Spl transcription factor
   probably via the posttranslational or transcriptional modification of
   the factor by TGase.}},

Volume = {{48}},

Abstract = {{Culture of the green mussel Perna viridis (L.) in Thai coastal waters is
   almost exclusively based on extensive pole culture, where spat are
   allowed to settle naturally on densely planted poles in shallow waters
   close to the shore. Such culture is limited in terms of space, and the
   shallow inshore regions suitable for it are vulnerable to pollution.
   There is immense potential for the development of suspended culture in
   Thai waters. In addition to increasing the yield and quality of the
   product, suspended cultures offer additional benefits such as providing
   habitats for the development of juvenile fish, and providing refugia
   from overfishing in relatively open waters. This study examines one
   potential drawback of suspended mussel culture in shallow waters such as
   are found in large areas of the Gulf of Thailand, namely the impact of
   such culture on the benthic communities. Nematode genera have been shown
   to be sensitive to ongoing physical and biological disturbance. In this
   study univariate and nonparametric multivariate analyses of nematode
   abundances are used to measure the extent of benthic impact resulting
   from a mussel raft. Although large differences in community structure
   are found beneath the raft, the areal extent of these changes is
   limited. It is concluded that if problems related to water quality and
   infrastructure can be dealt with, the localised benthic impact of such
   culture methods for the green mussel should not prevent their
   development in Thai coastal waters.}},

Abstract = {{A combined interpretation of seismic data from the 3850-km-long Russian
   seismic profile QUARTZ using chemical and nuclear explosions reveals
   complex structure of the lithosphere related to the regional tectonics.
   Our analysis is focused on the structure of the uppermost mantle and
   based on 2D ray-tracing and inversion of the data from all 51 shots
   along the profile, on 2D attenuation measurements, and on the results of
   an analysis of the long-range P(n) phase. Three groups of reflectors
   within the lithosphere are associated with regional- to global
   boundaries previously recognized in stable continental environments. One
   almost continuous upper mantle boundary occurs at 65 to 80-km depth and
   another with an approximately 40-km-thick low-velocity zone (LVZ) occurs
   at 120-140 km depth. The shallow upper mantle blocks and the extensive
   interfaces indicate strong upper mantle heterogeneity imaged by this
   unique profile. The thickness of the lithosphere varies from 220 km
   under the Baltic Shield to about 120-130 km under the tectonically
   active Himalayan Altay-Sayan fold belt. Within the lower part of the
   lithosphere, a zone of lower velocity, increased attenuation, and
   varying thickness might be related to hydration and partial melting,
   Large structural differences related to tectonic ages and histories are
   characteristic for the entire lithosphere and extend 200-400 km into the
   asthenosphere. Analysis of QUARTZ data gives confident indication of
   seismic heterogeneity from crustal to regional mantle scales indicating
   strong involvement of the mantle in tectonic processes. (C) 2000

   which is hydrophobic. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to image
   adsorbed VWF under aqueous conditions at physiologic pH and ionic
   strength. Individual VWF molecules were clearly discernible on both
   surfaces. On the hydrophobic surface, VWF displayed compact tertiary
   structures with rare: examples of extended molecules. In addition, these
   data revealed intramolecular structural arrangements of the repeat units
   within VWF multimers. On the hydrophilic mica surface, VWF displayed
   extended structures in which intramolecular repeat units were exposed.
   The lateral dimensions of VWF on mica (640 +/- 161 x 303 +/- 113 nm were
   larger than on the hydrophobic OTS (256 +/- 74 x 152 +/- 62 nm, P <
   0.005). Our results demonstrate how surface properties mediate the
   molecular level structure and probable function of VWF: and provide some
   essential groundwork to develop a mechanistic understandings of
   surface-induced thrombosis. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional microcrystals of OmpC osmoporin were air-dried slowly
   and imaged in air with an atomic force microscope (AFM). The overall
   structural features in AFM images are in good agreement with the X-ray
   diffraction data of these OmpC osmoporin crystals: monoclinic P2(1),
   with the unit cell constants a = 117.6 Angstrom, b = 110 Angstrom, c =
   298.4 Angstrom, beta = 97 degrees. Such a good correspondence between
   X-ray diffraction and AFM data suggests that the slow and mild
   air-drying of these crystals did not induce any significant alterations
   in the crystal lattices as expected upon crystal dehydration. At the
   (100) crystal face, individual trimeric protein-detergent complexes were
   resolved. These results show the potential for studying the molecular
   structure of microcrystals of integral membrane proteins. This study
   also suggests that the crystal grew in a fashion of rapid
   two-dimensional expansion along the be plane followed by a slow
   deposition along the a axis, perhaps as a rate-limiting nucleation
   process. Thus, AFM imaging of air-dried crystals would also be of
   considerable use in the early stages of a project to grow large

Abstract = {{Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is used to study the phase separation
   process occurring in block copolymers in the solid state. The
   simultaneous measurement of the amplitude and the phase of the
   oscillating cantilever in the tapping mode operation provides the
   surface topography along with the cartography of the microdomains of
   different mechanical properties. This technique thus allows to
   characterize the size and shape of those microdomains and their
   organization at the surface (e.g. cubic lattice spheres, hexagonal
   lattice of cylinders, or lamellae). In this study, a series of symmetric
   triblock copolymers made of a inner elastomeric sequence
   (poly(butadiene) or poly(alkylacrylate)) and two outer thermoplastic
   sequences (poly(methylmethacrylate)) is analyzed by AFM in the tapping
   mode. The microphase separation and their morphology are essential
   factors for the potential of these materials as a new class of
   thermoplastic elastomers. Special attention is paid to the control of
   the surface morphology, as observed by AFM, by the molecular structure
   of the copolymers (volume ratio of the sequences, molecular weight,
   length of the alkyl side group) and the experimental conditions used for
   the sample preparation. The molecular structure of the chains is
   completely controlled by the synthesis, which relies on the sequential
   living anionic polymerization of the comonomers. The copolymers are
   analyzed as solvent-cast films, whose characteristics depend on the
   solvent used and the annealing conditions. The surface arrangement of
   the phase-separated elastomeric and thermoplastic microdomains observed
   on the AFM phase images is discussed on the basis of quantitative
   information provided by the statistical analysis by Fourier transform
   and grain size distribution calculations. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{Solid state CP/MAS C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) study of the
   insoluble organic fraction isolated by HF/HCl treatment under an inert
   atmosphere from the Orgueil and Murchison carbonaceous meteorites is
   reported. Based on these spectra, eight different types of carbons (aro-
   and all-linked CH3, CH2, aliphatic C-linked to heteroelements,
   protonated and non-protonated aromatic C, carboxyls and carbonyls) were
   identified, their relative amounts were determined and theoretical
   NMR-derived H/C atomic ratios were calculated. Comparison of these H/C
   ratios with those obtained from elemental analysis revealed that a large
   part of the carbons of the insoluble fraction of both meteorites are not
   detected by CP/MAS C-13 NMR. Taking into account these undetected
   carbons, the relative abundance of aromatic carbons (as \% of the total
   carbons) was calculated as between 69 and 78\% in Orgueil and 61 and
   67\% in Murchison and thus shown to be much higher than previously
   thought. In addition, the NMR data allowed to calculate the ratio of
   non-protonated and protonated aromatic carbons. Based on previous
   studies on chemical and thermal degradation, the present NMR data were
   interpreted as reflecting the occurrence of highly substituted rather
   small aromatic moieties in these insoluble organic materials. Along with
   FTIR data, NMR results also pointed to a relatively high branching level
   in the aliphatic chains, especially for Murchison. According to the
   above results, the insoluble organic matter in these meteorites did not
   suffer a marked thermal maturation during the late hydrothermalism of
   the parent body. Its synthesis involved a statistical combination of all
   the possible bonds between -CH3, -CH2 and -CH radicals, producing both
   the aliphatic and the aromatic moieties. This model explains not only
   the chemical features of the chondritic insoluble organic material but
   also the typical FTIR signature of the interstellar medium. Therefore,
   organic material found in the interstellar medium and that incorporated
   in the most primitive objects of the solar system seem to share a common
   organosynthesis. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   parts per thousand and delta O-17 = -13.5 +/- 2.6 parts per thousand. If
   Al-rich chondrules were mixtures of ferromagnesian chondrules and CAI
   material, their bulk chemical compositions would require them to exhibit
   larger O-16 enrichments than we observe. Therefore, Al-rich chondrules
   are not simple mixtures of these two components. Three chondrules
   exhibit significant internal isotopic heterogeneity indicative of
   partial exchange with a gaseous reservoir. Porphyritic Al-rich
   chondrules are consistently O-16-rich relative to nonporphyritic ones,
   suggesting that degree of melting is a key factor and pointing to a
   nebular setting for the isotopic exchange process. Because Al-rich
   chondrules are closely related to ferromagnesian chondrules, their
   radiogenic Mg isotopic abundances can plausibly be applied to help
   constrain the timing or location of chondrule formation. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Oxygen isotope ratios in phenocrysts from recent Theistareykir lavas
   (Iceland) are consistently O-18-depleted relative to common terrestrial
   basalts (e.g. delta O-18 olivine = 4.7-4.1 parts per thousand) and
   correlate with geochemical indices of `enrichment' (e.g. K2O/TiO2;
   La/Sm) and major element indices of differentiation (e.g. Mg\#;
   CaO/Na2O). The sense of these correlations is that decreasing delta O-18
   is accompanied by increasing `enriched' geochemical signatures and an
   increasing extent of differentiation. These trends are similar to
   (although more subtle than) those defined by highly differentiated and
   contaminated Icelandic andesites, dacites and rhyolites. The trends we
   observe are consistent with models in which primary recent Theistareykir
   magmas are highly `depleted' in their incompatible element geochemistry
   and similar in delta O-18 to common terrestrial basalts; differentiation
   of these magmas is accompanied by contamination by the low delta O-18,
   and on average more `enriched' rocks of the Icelandic crust to produce
   the observed spectrum in delta O-18 and other geochemical indices. Our
   results suggest that geochemical variations among recent Theistareykir
   lavas are only indirect constraints on the composition and dynamics of
   the Iceland plume. Extrapolation of the geochemical trends we observe to
   oxygen isotope compositions within the range of common oceanic basalts
   suggests that primary recent Theistareykir magmas are exceptionally
   depleted (e.g. La/Sm = 0.2-0.5), indicating unusually high degrees
   and/or multiple stages of melting of their sources. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Nautile submersible investigations of mud volcanoes and brine seep areas
   of the eastern Mediterranean Sea during the MEDINAUT cruise in November
   1998 discovered extensive areas of authigenic carbonate crusts
   associated with methane emissions. Carbonate crusts form pavements,
   round slabs and circular mounds on the central, most active parts of mud
   volcanoes and in a fault-related valley where brines have accumulated to
   form a submarine brine lake. Authigenic carbonate nodules have been
   recovered from the same areas during the MEDINETH cruise in July 1999.
   Large C-13 depletions of authigenic calcite, aragonite and dolomite
   indicate methane as a major carbon source for the carbonate. Crust
   pavements are formed when methane from a freshly emplaced,
   methane-charged mud flow is oxidised at the seafloor. In this
   environment, where bottom waters provide the sulphate and magnesium,
   aragonite is favoured versus calcite and accounts for the majority of
   the methane-related authigenic carbonates. Calcite, when present,
   contains significant amounts of Mg2+ (high-Mg calcite), and possibly
   other divalent ions in its crystal lattice. In areas of brine seep and
   accumulation, dolomitic nodules are present at shallow depth in the
   sediment. The O-18 enrichment of the authigenic carbonates (up to 4
   parts per thousand greater than calculated values for carbonates
   precipitating from modern eastern Mediterranean bottom waters) is
   interpreted as due to precipitation from O-18-rich fluids rather than as
   a temperature effect. The source of the O-18-rich fluids may be multiple
   and possibly includes the destabilisation of gas hydrates present at
   shallow subbottom depth, and the seepage of relic Messinian brines. (C)

Abstract = {{Some DNA data show patterns of variation not expected under the neutral
   theory. Here, the independent multicodon (IMC) model, a nearly neutral
   mutation model assuming no interaction among codons, was studied when
   population size changes using computer simulation. Patterns of variation
   expected under the model were investigated using statistics for the
   neutrality tests. The average dispersion index is more than one when
   population size changes slowly but it never becomes large. The diversity
   at linked silent site decreases when the strength of selection is
   intermediate and the reduction is larger when population size changes
   slowly. Tajima's (1989. Genetics 123, 585-595) D is generally negative.
   Rejections by the Tajima's test occur more frequently if population size
   changes quickly but the effect of selection is confounded with the size
   change itself in this case. If we apply the test of McDonald and
   Kreitman (1991. Nature 351, 652-654), the rejection is always in the
   direction of excess replacement polymorphisms. The rejection probability
   decreases as the rate of population size changes decreases. These
   results show that the predictions of the IMC model are consistent with
   the pattern observed in mitochondrial DNA data but not consistent with
   some data of nuclear DNA. Interaction among codons or variable selection
   would be necessary to explain such cases. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{The neutralist-selectionist debate should not be viewed as a dichotomy
   but as a continuum. While the strictly neutral model suggests a
   neutralist-selectionist dichotomy, the nearly neutral model is a
   continuous model spanning strict neutrality through weak selection (Ns
   similar to 1) to deterministic selection (Ns > 3). We illustrate these
   points with polymorphism and divergence data from a sample of 73 genes
   (31 mitochondrial, 36 nuclear genes from Drosophila, and six Arabidopsis
   data sets). In an earlier study we used the McDonald-Kreitman (MK) test
   to show that amino acid replacement polymorphism in animal mitochondrial
   genes and Arabidopsis genes show a consistent trend toward negative
   selection, whereas nuclear genes from Drosophila span a range from
   negative selection, through neutrality, to positive selection. Here we
   analyze a subset of these genes (13 Drosophila nuclear, ten
   mitochondrial, and six Arabidopsis nuclear) for polymorphism and
   divergence of conservative and radical amino acid replacements (a
   protein-based conservative-radical MK, or pMK, test). The distinct
   patterns of selection between the different genomes is not apparent with
   the pMK test. Different definitions of conservative and radical (based
   on amino acid polarity volume or charge) give inconsistent results
   across genes. We suggest that segregating fitness difference between
   silent and replacement mutations are more visible to selections than are
   segregating fitness differences between conservative and radical amino
   acid and replacement mutations are more visible to selection than are
   segregating fitness differences between conservative and radical amino
   acid mutations. New data on the variation among genes with different
   opportunities for positive and negative selection are as important to
   the continuum view of the neutralist-selectionist debate as is the
   distribution of selection coefficients within individual genes. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{NKX3A (NKX3.1) is a recently identified androgen-regulated gene that is
   largely specific to prostate for expression and likely to code for a
   homeobox protein. Here we report the full-length mRNA and genomic
   organization of human NKX3.1. There are at least five different splice
   variants of NKX3.1 mRNA that result in different open reading frames
   (ORFs). There is extensive similarity between the human and the mouse
   NKX3.1 cDNA sequences outside of the ORFs (greater than 60\% overall
   identity), which may be involved in modulating NKX3.1 expression. In
   addition to its androgen regulation in the prostate cancer cell line
   LNCaP, we show that NKX3.1 expression is androgen-dependent in the CWR22
   prostate cancer xenograft model. Interestingly, NKX3.1 is highly
   expressed in the androgen-independent derivative CWR22R in the absence
   of androgens, indicating that it may be deregulated in advanced prostate
   cancer. Using a Green Flourescent Protein fusion construct, we show that
   NKX3.1 is a nuclear protein consistent with its proposed function as a
   homeobox transcription factor. Furthermore, in addition to androgens,
   NKX3.1 expression is up-regulated by 17 beta -estradiol, but not by
   progesterone, dexamethasone, or 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine in LNCaP cells.
   Regulation of NKX3.1 by androgens and 17 beta -estradiol in prostate
   cancer cells and its deregulation in androgen-independent prostate
   cancer suggest that it may have important regulatory roles during
   prostate cancer progression. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The transcription factor DREF regulates proliferation-related genes in
   Drosophila. With two-hybrid screening using DREF as a bait, we have
   obtained a clone encoding a protein homologous to human
   myelodysplasia/myeloid leukemia factor 1 (hMLF1). We termed the protein
   Drosophila MLF (dMLF); it consists of a polypeptide of 309 amino acid
   residues, whose sequence shares 23.1\% identity with hMLF1. High
   conservation of 54.2\% identity over 107 amino acids was found in the
   central region. The dMLF gene was mapped to 52D on the second chromosome
   by in situ hybridization. Interaction between dMLF and DREF in vitro
   could be confirmed by glutathione S-transferase pull-down assay, with
   the conserved central region appearing to play an important role in
   this. Northern blot hybridization analysis revealed dMLF mRNA levels to
   be high in unfertilized eggs, early embryos, pupae and adult males, and
   relatively low in adult females and larvae. This fluctuation of mRNA
   during Drosophila development is similar to that observed for DREF mRNA,
   except in the pupa and adult male. Using a specific antibody against the
   dMLF, we performed immunofluorescent staining of Drosophila Kc cells and
   showed a primarily cytoplasmic staining, whereas DREF localizes in the
   nucleus. However, dMLF protein contains a putative 14-3-3 binding motif
   involved in the subcellular localization of various regulatory
   molecules, and interaction with DREF could be regulated through this
   motif. The transgenic fly data suggesting the genetic interaction
   between DREF and dMLF support this possibility. Characterization of dMLF
   in the present study provides the molecular basis for analysis of its
   significance in Drosophila. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The different roles of variable mantle sources and intra-crustal
   differentiation processes at Bakening volcano (Kamchatka) and
   contemporaneous basaltic monogenetic centers are studied using major and
   trace elements and isotopic data. Three suites of volcanic activity are
   recognized: (1) plateau basalts of Lower Pleistocene age; (2) andesites
   and dacites of the Bakening volcano, the New Bakening volcano dacitic
   centers nearby; and (3) contemporaneous basaltic cinder cones erupted
   along subduction zone--parallel N-S faults. Age-data show that the last
   eruptions in the Bakening area occurred only 600-1200 years ago,
   suggesting the volcano is potentially active.
   Major element variations and petrographic observations provides evidence
   for a fractionation assemblage of olivine, clinopyroxene,
   +/-plagioclase, +/-magnetite (?) within the basaltic suite. The
   fractionation in the andesites and dacites is dominated by amphibole,
   clinopyroxene. orthopyroxene and plagioclase plus minor amounts of
   magnetite and apatite. The youngest cpx-opx-andesites of Bakening main
   volcano deviate from that trend. Their source was probably formed by
   mixing of basaltic magmas into the silicic magma chamber of the Bakening
   volcano. Overall trace element patterns as well as the Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic
   compositions are quite similar in all rocks despite large differences in
   their chemical composition (from basalt to rhyodacite). In detail
   however, the andesite-dacites of the central Bakening volcano show a
   stronger enrichment in the more incompatible elements and depletion in
   HREE compared to the monogenetic basaltic centers. This results in a
   crossing of the REE-pattern for the two suites. The decrease in the
   HREEs can be explained by amphibole fractionation. A slab component is
   less likely because it would result in fractionation of the HREE from
   each other, which is not observed. The higher relative amounts of LILE
   in the dacitic and the large scatter in the basaltic rocks must be the
   result of a variable source enrichment by slab-derived fluids
   overprinting a variable depleted mantle wedge. The plateau basalts are
   less depleted in HFSE and show a more fractionated HREE pattern. These
   lavas could either result from a slab component or the addition of an
   OIB-type enriched mantle in their source. (C) 2000 EIsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{Calmodulin (CaM), a keg calcium sensor in all eukaryotes, regulates
   diverse cellular processes by interacting with other proteins. To
   isolate CaM binding proteins involved in ethylene signal transduction,
   we screened an expression library prepared from ethylene-treated
   Arabidopsis seedlings with S-35-labeled CaM. A cDNA clone, EICBP
   (Ethylene-Induced CaM Binding Protein), encoding a protein that
   interacts with activated CaM was isolated in this screening. The CaM:
   binding domain in EICBP was mapped to the C-terminus of the protein.
   These results indicate that calcium, through CaM, could regulate the
   activity of EICBP. The EICBP is expressed in different tissues and its
   expression in seedlings is induced by ethylene. The EICBP contains, in
   addition to a CaM binding domain, several features that are typical of
   transcription factors. These include a DNA-binding domain at the N
   terminus, an acidic region at the C terminus, and nuclear localization
   signals. In database searches a partial cDNA (CG-1) encoding a
   DNA-binding motif from parsley and an ethylene up-regulated partial cDNA
   from tomato (ER66) showed significant similarity to EICBP. In addition,
   five hypothetical proteins in the Arabidopsis genome also showed a very
   high sequence similarity with EICBP, indicating that there are several
   EICBP-related proteins in Arabidopsis. The structural features of EICBP
   are conserved in all EICBP-related proteins in Arabidopsis, suggesting
   that they may constitute a new family of DNA binding proteins and are
   Likely to be involved in modulating gene expression in the presence of
   ethylene. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is an autosomal dominant
   form of diabetes characterized by early onset of pancreatic dysfunction.
   MODY type 3 is caused by mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor
   (HNF)-1 alpha. During a screening of Norwegian patients with suspected
   MODY we identified two novel HNF-1 alpha mutations, P112L and Q466X. The
   molecular mechanisms underlying the disease were studied by analyzing
   the DNA binding properties, transcriptional activation, and subcellular
   localization of HNF-1 alpha P112L and Q466X compared to wild type HNF-1
   alpha. P112L had reduced ability to bind an HNF1 consensus sequence and
   to activate transcription. Q486X did not differ from wild type HNF-1
   alpha in DNA binding activity. Transactivation, however, was markedly
   reduced. When both mutants were coexpressed with wild type HNF-1 alpha
   in HeLa cells, transcriptional activity appeared unaffected, suggesting
   that a dominant-negative mechanism was not present. Immunolocalization
   experiments showed that P112L HNF-1 alpha was correctly targeted to
   nuclei in HeLa cells. In contrast, some Q466X HNF-1 alpha protein was
   retained in the cytoplasm, which indicated that the mechanism for
   nuclear localization was disturbed. Thus, the HNF-1 alpha mutations
   P112L and Q466X both seem to impair pancreatic p cell function by loss
   of-function mechanisms; P112L by reduced DNA binding and reduced ability
   to transactivate, and Q466X by reduced transactivation and incomplete
   nuclear targeting. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{An alternatively spliced isoform of human estrogen receptor beta (ER
   beta) has been isolated from normal human testis mRNA that is
   coexpressed with wild-type ERP by reverse transcription polymerase chain
   reaction (RT-PCR). Sequence analysis of the ER beta isoform PCR product
   reveals the absence of 139 bp that corresponds to the entire exon 5 of
   wild-type ER beta, which predicts 60 lack part of the hormone-binding
   domain, The transient expression of the exon 5-deleted isoform of ERP
   (ERP beta Delta5) had no effect on basal transactivation activity of an
   estrogen-responsive luciferase reporter gene. This finding was in
   contrast to the previous reports that the exon 8-deleted isoform of ER
   alpha (ER alpha Delta5) acts as a dominant positive receptor, increasing
   basal gene transactivation itself. Moreover, when ER beta Delta5 was
   cotransfected with the wild-type ER alpha or ER beta, it behaved as a
   dominant negative receptor that inhibited not only estradiol-stimulated
   transactivation by ER beta but also that by ER alpha. The
   ligand-independent nuclear localization of ER beta Delta5 was confirmed
   by immunohistochemistry, and the coexpression of the isoform and the
   wild-type receptors could be observed in a single cell that transfected
   with both receptor cDNAs, These findings indicate that ER beta Delta5
   has a potential as a dominant negative receptor that blocks both ER
   alpha and ER beta signaling pathways, suggesting some physiological
   roles of this isoform as an ``ER inhibitor''. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{The serine protease subtilisin is an important industrial enzyme as well
   as a model for understanding the enormous rate enhancements affected by
   enzymes. For these reasons along with the timely cloning of the gene,
   ease of expression and purification and availability of atomic
   resolution structures, subtilisin became a model system for protein
   engineering studies in the 1980s. Fifteen years later, mutations in well
   over 50\% of the 275 amino acids of subtilisin have been reported in the
   scientific literature. Most subtilisin engineering has involved
   catalytic amino acids, substrate binding regions and stabilizing
   mutations. Stability has been the property of subtilisin which has been
   most amenable to enhancement, yet perhaps least understood. This review
   will give a brief overview of the subtilisin engineering field,
   critically review what has been learned about subtilisin stability from
   protein engineering experiments and conclude with some speculation about
   the prospects for future subtilisin engineering. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Previous studies have shown that during hypoxia, neuronal nuclear high
   affinity Ca2+-ATPase activity is increased in the cerebral cortex of
   newborn piglets. The present study tests the hypothesis that
   pretreatment with N-nitro-L-arginine (NNLA) will prevent the
   hypoxia-induced increase in high affinity Ca2+-ATPase activity in
   cortical neuronal nuclear membrane of newborn piglets. We also tested
   the hypothesis that nitration is a mechanism of elevation of the high
   affinity Ca2+-ATPase activity during hypoxia. Studies were performed in
   Rye normoxic, five hypoxic, and six NNLA-pretreated (40 mg/kg) hypoxic
   newborn piglets. Cerebral cortical neuronal nuclei were isolated and the
   high affinity Ca2+-ATPase activity was determined. Further, normoxic
   samples were aliquoted into two sub-groups for in vitro nitration with
   0.5 mM peroxynitrite and subsequent determination of the high affinity
   Ca2+-ATPase activity. The activity increased from 309+/-40 nmol Pi/mg
   protein/h in the normoxic group to 520+/-108 nmol Pi/mg protein/h in the
   hypoxic group (P<0.05). In the NNLA-pretreated group, the activity was
   442+/-53 nmol Pi/mg protein/h (P<0.05), which is 25\% lower than in the
   hypoxic group. Tn the nitrated group the enzyme activity increased to
   554+/-59 nmol Pi/mg protein/h (P<0.05). Thus peroxynitrire-induced
   nitration in vitro increased the high affinity Ca2+-ATPase activity and
   NNLA administration in vivo partially prevented the hypoxia induced
   increase in neuronal nuclear high affinity Ca2+-ATPase activity. We
   conclude that the hypoxia-induced increase in nuclear membrane high
   affinity Ca2+-ATPase activity is NO-mediated and that nitration of the
   enzyme is a mechanism of its modification. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Cranin (dystroglycan), a mucin-like extracellular matrix receptor
   comprised of two subunits (alpha and beta), is involved in regulating
   cell-matrix interactions in a variety of tissues, including brain. A
   basic issue remains unresolved concerning the distribution of cranin in
   brain: are the alpha and beta subunits coordinately expressed at the
   synapse? We report here that cranin is indeed enriched progressively in
   synaptosomes and synaptic membranes of sheep brain, as assessed by
   immunoblotting and laminin-blotting assays, and that the extent of
   enrichment is similar for both alpha and beta subunits. These findings
   support the hypothesis that cranin (dystroglycan) contributes to
   synaptic function in the CNS. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science BN. All rights

Abstract = {{Recent data imply that mitochondrial regulation of calcium is critical
   in the process leading to hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. The aim was to
   study the subcellular distribution of calcium in correlation with
   ultrastructural changes after hypoxia-ischemia in neonatal rats.
   Seven-day-old rats were subjected to permanent unilateral carotid artery
   ligation and exposure to hypoxia (7.7\% oxygen in nitrogen) for 90 min.
   Animals were perfusion-fixed after 30 min, 3 h or 24 h of reperfusion.
   Sections were sampled for light microscopy and electron microscopy
   combined with the oxalate-pyroantimonate technique. At 30 min and 3 h of
   reflow, 3 progressive accumulation of calcium was detected in the
   endoplasmic reticulum, cytoplasm, nucleus and, most markedly, in the
   mitochondrial matrix of neurons in the gray matter in the core area of
   injury. Some mitochondria developed a considerable degree of swelling
   reaching a diameter of several mum at 3 h of reflow whereas the majority
   of mitochondria appeared moderately affected. Chromatin condensation was
   observed in nuclei of many cells with severely swollen mitochondria with
   calcium deposits. A whole spectrum of morphological features ranging
   from necrosis to apoptosis was seen in degenerating cells. After 24 h,
   there was extensive injury in the cerebral cortex as judged by breaks of
   mitochondrial and plasma membranes, and a general decrease of cellular
   electron density. In the white matter of the core area of injury, the
   axonal elements exhibited varicosity-like swellings filled with
   calcium-pyroantimonate deposits. Furthermore, the thin myelin sheaths
   were loaded with calcium. Numerous oligodendroglia-like cells displayed
   apoptotic morphology `with shrunken cytoplasm and chromatin
   condensation, whereas astroglial necrosis was not seen. In conclusion,
   markedly swollen `giant' mitochondria with large amounts of calcium were
   found at 3 h of reperfusion often in neuronal cells with condensation of
   the nuclear chromatin. The results are discussed in relation to
   mitochondrial permeability transition and activation of apoptotic
   processes. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In 1940, Tetrahymena pyriformis GL was reported amicronucleate by W. H.
   Furgason. Unable to renew its genetic complement through conjugation,
   the ciliate still thrives with unchanged phenotype. This fact indicates
   physical integrity of the haploid macronuclear genome (5
   ``chromosomes{''}) during cell division, as also reflected in 90
   unit-sized chromatin aggregates ({''}subnuclei{''}) distributed equally
   to the daughters. This stands in contrast to biochemical sizing of bulk
   macronuclear DNA in thousands of subchromosomal DNA fragments
   distributed randomly during cell division. The purpose was to
   investigate the problem utilizing vanadate that affects nuclear division
   so that the daughters may receive anything from the entire G(2)-nucleus
   to no nucleus at all {[}39]; in theory a single aggregate suffices to
   survive. Single cell cultures of daughters, derived from cells divided
   in vanadate, revealed survival of all, but not anucleate, daughters and
   progeny of unchanged phenotype, hence indicating that the macronuclear
   chromatin aggregates contain full genetic complement. ``Amitosis{''} in
   Tetrahymena is genome segregation but equal karyokinesis depends on
   correct positioning of the macronucleus, properly related to its
   anterior and posterior movements prior to elongation as though it
   becomes anchored to both cell poles. Vanadate disturbed correct
   positioning of the nucleus.}},

   528 amino acids. The in vitro translated protein shows a molecular
   weight of 57 kDa. WHSC2 has two nuclear translocation sequences which
   actively mediate its transport to the nucleus, as shown in
   whsc2-GFP-transfected NIH-3T3, We also found a helix-loop-helix (HLH)
   motif in region 130-185, Since members of the HLH family control
   differentiation and cell cycle progression, we hypothesize that WHSC2

   affect HO-2 expression, it significantly increased the expression of
   HO-1, both at mRNA (about 3-fold) and protein (about 2-fold) levels,
   reflecting the increased expression of HO-1 in the brown adipotytes and
   endothelial cells of parenchymal capillaries. Western blotting of

Abstract = {{As a result of the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant (NPP)
   the environment was contaminated with spent nuclear fuel. The U-236
   isotope was used in this study to monitor the spent uranium from nuclear
   fallout in soil samples collected in the vicinity of the Chernobyl NPP.
   A rapid and sensitive analytical procedure for uranium isotopic ratio
   measurement in environmental samples based on inductively coupled plasma
   quadrupole mass spectrometry with a hexapole collision cell
   (HEX-ICP-QMS) was developed. Figures of merit for the HEX-ICP-QMS were
   studied with a plasma-shielded torch using different nebulizers {[}such
   as an ultrasonic nebulizer (USN) and a Meinhard nebulizer] for the
   solution introduction. An U-238(+) ion intensity of up to 27 000 MHz/ppm
   in HEX-ICP-QMS with USN was observed by introducing helium into the
   hexapole collision cell as the collision gas at a how rate of 10 mL
   min(-1). The formation rate of uranium hydride ions UH+/U+ of 2 x 10(-6)
   was obtained by using USN with a membrane desolvator. The detection
   limit for U-236 in 10 mug L-1 uranium solution was 3 pg L-1
   corresponding to the limit of U-236/U-238 ratio determination of 3 x
   10(-7). in the case of low isotopic abundance of U-236 (<10(-5)). the
   measured isotopic ratio in the synthetic mixture was systematically
   lower than the calculated ratio. The precision of uranium isotopic ratio
   measurements in 10 <mu>g L-l laboratory uranium isotopic standard
   solution was 0.13\% (U-235/U-238) and 0.33\% (U-236/U-238) using a
   Meinhard nebulizer and 0.45\% (U-235/U-238) and 0.88\% (U-236/U-238)
   using an USN. The isotopic composition of all investigated Chernobyl
   soil samples differed from those of natural uranium: i.e. in these
   samples the U-236/U-238 ratio ranged from 10(-5) to 10(-3). Results of
   isotopic ratio measurement by HEX-ICP-QMS in soil samples are in
   agreement with those obtained by using a double-focusing sector field
   ICP-MS within experimental errors.(C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

   to gas and/or time consuming multiple precipitation steps or insensitive
   nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques. in the electrospray method
   developed here, lengthy analyses requiring precipitation of phosphate
   are unnecessary. Moreover, there is no requirement for conversion to a
   simple gas and indirect evaluation. Accuracy is demonstrated by good
   agreement with NMR measurements on concentrated laboratory prepared
   chemical solutions. After dilution, electrospray analyses gave similar

Abstract = {{The vitamin D receptor (VDR) is a member of the steroid/retinoid
   receptor superfamily of nuclear receptors that has potential
   tumor-suppressive functions. We show here that VDR interacts with and is
   regulated by BAG1L, a nuclear protein that binds heat shock 70-kDa
   (Hsp70) family molecular chaperones. Endogenous BAG1L can be
   eo-immunoprecipitated with VDR from prostate cancer cells (ALVA31;
   LNCaP) in a ligand-dependent manner. BAG1L, but not shorter non-nuclear
   isoforms of this protein (BAG1; BAG1M/Rap46), markedly enhanced, in a
   ligand-dependent manner, the ability of VDR to trans-activate reporter
   gene plasmids containing a vitamin D response element in transient
   transfection assays. Mutant BAG1L lacking the C-terminal Hsc70-binding
   domain suppressed tin a concentration-dependent fashion) VDR-mediated
   trans-activation of vitamin D response element-containing reporter gene
   plasmids, without altering levels of VDR or endogenous BAG1L protein,
   suggesting that it operates as a trans-dominant inhibitor of BAG1L. Gene
   transfer-mediated elevations in BAG1L protein levels in a prostate
   cancer cell line (PC3), which is moderately responsive to VDR ligands,
   increased the ability of natural (1 alpha ,25(OH)(2) vitamin D-3) and
   synthetic (1 alpha ,25-dihydroxy19-nor-22(E)-vitamin D-3) VDR ligands to
   induce expression of the VDR target gene, p21(Waf1), and suppress DNA
   synthesis. Thus, BAG1L is a direct regulator of VDR, which enhances its
   trans-activation function and improves tumor cell responses to
   growth-suppressive VDR ligands.}},

Abstract = {{Drosophila Uba2 and Ubc9 SUMO-1 conjugation enzyme homologs (DmUba2 and
   DmUbc9) were isolated as calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII)
   interacting proteins by yeast two-hybrid screening of an adult head cDNA
   library. We found that at least one isoform of Drosophila neuronal
   CaMXII is conjugated to DmSUMO-1 in vivo. The interactions observed in
   the two-hybrid screen may therefore reflect catalytic events. To
   understand the role of SUMO conjugation in the brain, we undertook a
   characterization of the system. The other required components of the
   system, Drosophila Aos1 and SUMO-1 (DmAos1 and DmSUMO-1), were
   identified in expressed sequence tag data base searches. Purified
   recombinant DmUbaB/DmAos1 dimer can activate DmSUMO-1 in vitro and
   transfer DmSUMO-1 to recombinant DmUbc9. DmSUMO-1 conjugation occurs in
   all developmental stages of Drosophila and in the adult central nervous
   system. Overexpression of a putative dominant negative DmUba2(C175S)
   mutant protein in the Drosophila central nervous system resulted in an
   increase in overall DmSUMO-1 conjugates and a base-sensitive p120
   species, which is likely to be DmUba2(C175S) linked to endogenous
   DmSUMO-1 through an oxygen ester bond. Overexpression of DmUba2(wt)
   protein in vivo also led to increased levels of DmSUMO-1 conjugates.
   High level overexpression of either DmUba2(wt) or DmUba2(C175S) in the
   Drosophila central nervous system caused pupal and earlier stage
   lethality. Expression in the developing eye led to a rough eye phenotype
   with retinal degeneration. These results suggest that normal SUMO
   conjugation is essential in the differentiated nervous system and reveal
   a potential novel mechanism that regulates neuronal
   calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II function.}},

Abstract = {{Receptor-interacting protein 140 (RIP140) encodes a histone deacetylase
   (HDAC) inhibitor-sensitive repressive activity. Direct interaction of
   RIP140 with HDAC1 and HDAC3 occurs in vitro and in vivo as demonstrated
   in co-immunoprecipitation and glutathione S-transferase pull-down
   experiments. The HDAC-interacting domain of RIP140 is mapped to its
   N-terminal domain, between amino acids 78 and 303 based upon glutathione
   S-transferase pull-down experiments. In chromatin immunoprecipitation
   assays, it is demonstrated that histone deacetylation occurs at the
   chromatin region of the Ga14 binding sites as a result of Ga14 DNA
   binding domain-tethered RIP expression. The immunocomplexes of RIP140
   from cells transfected with RIP140 and HDAC are able to deacetylate
   histone proteins in vitro. This study presents the first evidence for
   RIP140 as a negative coregulator for nuclear receptor actions by
   directly recruiting histone deacetylases and categorizes RIP140 as a
   novel negative coregulator that is able to directly interact with HDACs.}},

Abstract = {{Members of the p160 coactivator family (steroid receptor coactivator-l
   (SRC-1), glucocorticoid receptor interacting protein 1 (GRIP1), and
   activator of thyroid and retinoic acid receptors (ACTR)) mediate
   transcriptional activation by nuclear receptors, After being recruited
   to the promoter by nuclear receptors, the p160 coactivator transmits the
   activating signal via two C-terminal activation domains, AD1 and AD2,
   AD1 is a binding site for the related coactivators cAMP-response element
   binding protein binding protein (CBP) and p300, whereas AD2 binds to
   another coactivator, coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1
   (CARM1), a protein-arginine methyltransferase. The current study
   explored the cooperative functional and mechanistic relationships among
   GRIP1, CARM1, and p300 in transient transfection assays, where they
   enhanced the ability of the estrogen receptor (ER) to activate
   transcription of a reporter gene. The coactivator functions of p300 and
   CARM1 depended on the co-expression of GRIP1. Simultaneous co-expression
   of all three coactivators caused a synergistic enhancement of ER
   function. Deletion of the AD1 domain of GRIP1 abolished the ability of
   p300 to potentiate ER activity but had no effect on CARM1-mediated
   stimulation. In contrast, when the AD2 domain of GRIP1 was deleted, p300
   still stimulated ER function through the mutant GRIP1, but CARM1 failed
   to do so. Thus, both binding of p300 to AD1 and binding of CARM1 to AD2
   are required for their respective coactivator functions and for their
   synergy. Furthermore, CARM1 and p300 function independently through
   different activating domains of GRIP1, and their synergy suggests that
   they enhance transcription by different, complementary. mechanisms.}},
