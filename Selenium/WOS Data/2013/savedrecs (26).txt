The high prompt neutron source (up to 1.6 x 10(19) neutrons per shot) results in the need for significant fixed shielding. Concrete shielding approximately 2 m thick is used for the primary (target bay) shield. Penetrations in this shield, including those required for 192 laser beams, utilities, diagnostics, and 19 shielded personnel access doors, make the design challenging. An additional 28 shield doors are part of the secondary shield. In addition, the prompt neutron pulse results in activated air within the target bay, requiring special ventilation considerations. Finally, targets can use a number of hazardous and radioactive materials including tritium, beryllium, and depleted uranium (the latter of which results in the generation of small quantities of fission products). Frequent access is required to the associated potentially contaminated volumes for experimental setup, facilitating the need for local exhaust ventilation to manage these hazards. This paper reviews some of these challenges, design considerations, and the engineering solutions to these design requirements.

SAFETY SYSTEMS AND ACCESS CONTROL IN THE NATIONAL IGNITION FACILITY	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						computers; lasers; occupational safety; radiation protection		The National Ignition Facility (NIF) is the world's largest and most energetic laser system. The facility has the potential to generate ionizing radiation due to the interaction between the laser beams and target material, with neutrons and gamma rays being produced during deuterium-tritium fusion reactions. To perform these experiments, several types of hazards must be mitigated and controlled to ensure personnel safety. NIF uses a real-time safety system to monitor and mitigate the hazards presented by the facility. The NIF facility Safety Interlock System (SIS) monitors for oxygen deficiency and controls access to the facility preventing exposure to laser light and radiation from the Radiation Generating Devices. It also interfaces to radiation monitoring and other radiological monitoring and alarm systems. The SIS controls permissives to the hazard-generating equipment and annunciates hazard levels in the facility. To do this reliably and safely, the SIS has been designed as a fail-safe system with a proven performance record now spanning over 10 y. This paper discusses the SIS, its design, implementation, operator interfaces, validation/verification, and the hazard mitigation approaches employed in the NIF. A brief discussion of the Failure Modes and Effect Analysis supporting the SIS will also be presented. The paper ends with a general discussion of SIS do's and don'ts and common design flaws that should be avoided in SIS design.

J	Draggoo, V				Draggoo, Vaughn			TRITIUM AND IGNITION TARGET MANAGEMENT AT THE NATIONAL IGNITION FACILITY	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						computers; hydrogen; lasers; tritium		Isotopic mixtures of hydrogen constitute the basic fuel for fusion targets of the National Ignition Facility (NIF). A typical NIF fusion target shot requires approximately 0.5 mmoles of hydrogen gas and as much as 750 GBq (20 Ci) of H-3. Isotopic mix ratios are specified according to the experimental shot/test plan and the associated test objectives. The hydrogen isotopic concentrations, absolute amounts, gas purity, configuration of the target, and the physical configuration of the NIF facility are all parameters and conditions that must be managed to ensure the quality and safety of operations. An essential and key step in the preparation of an ignition target is the formation of a similar to 60 mu m thick hydrogen "ice" layer on the inner surface of the target capsule. The Cryogenic Target Positioning System (Cryo-Tarpos) provides gas handling, cyro-cooling, x-ray imaging systems, and related instrumentation to control the volumes and temperatures of the multiphase (solid, liquid, and gas) hydrogen as the gas is condensed to liquid, admitted to the capsule, and frozen as a single spherical crystal of hydrogen in the capsule. The hydrogen fuel gas is prepared in discrete 1.7 cc aliquots in the LLNL Tritium Facility for each ignition shot. Post-shot hydrogen gas is recovered in the NIF Tritium Processing System (TPS). Gas handling systems, instrumentation and analytic equipment, material accounting information systems, and the shot planning systems must work together to ensure that operational and safety requirements are met.

Along with the use of tritium and depleted uranium, shots generating neutrons create prompt radiation fields as well as fission and activation products. In order to assure readiness for these hazards, a series of readiness reviews was conducted as the hazards were introduced. Each step was built upon the previous steps, as well as the basic infrastructure and operating capability of the laser facility. A detailed preparation plan for the introduction of these hazards was developed. This included ensuring required equipment was in place and ready, all plans and procedures were developed, and personnel were trained and qualified to perform work in the environment. The approach for preparing the facility for operations under the new set of conditions, the preparations for the readiness reviews, the review process, as well as the approach to initial operations are discussed.

STANDING UP THE NATIONAL IGNITION FACILITY RADIATION PROTECTION PROGRAM	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						emergency planning; occupational safety; radiation protection; radioactive materials		Operation of the NIF requires a large and varied number of routine and infrequent activities involving contaminated and radioactive systems, both in servicing online equipment and offline refurbishment of components. Routine radiological operations include up to several dozen entries into contaminated systems per day, multiple laboratories refurbishing radiologically impacted parts, handling of tens of curies of tritium, and (eventually) tens of workers spending most of their day working in radiation areas and handling moderately activated parts. Prior to the introduction of radioactive materials and neutron producing experiments (capable of causing activation), very few of the operating staff had any radiological qualifications or experience. To support the full NIF operating program, over 600 radiological workers needed to be trained, and a functional and large-scale radiological protection program needed to be put in place. It quickly became evident that there was a need to supplement the LLNL site radiological protection staff with additional radiological controls technicians and a radiological protection staff within NIF operations to manage day-to-day activities. This paper discusses the approach taken to stand up the radiological protection program and some lessons learned.

EXPERIENCES MANAGING RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL AT THE NATIONAL IGNITION FACILITY	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						contamination; fusion; lasers; neutrons		National Ignition Facility at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory is the world's largest and most energetic laser system for inertial confinement fusion and experiments studying high energy density science. Many experiments performed at the National Ignition Facility involve radioactive materials; these may take the form of tritium and small quantities of depleted uranium used in targets, activation products created by neutron-producing fusion experiments, and fission products produced by the fast fissioning of the depleted uranium. While planning for the introduction of radioactive material, it was recognized that some of the standard institutional processes would need to be customized to accommodate aspects of NIF operations, such as surface contamination limits, radiological postings, airborne tritium monitoring protocols, and personnel protective equipment. These customizations were overlaid onto existing work practices to accommodate the new hazard of radioactive materials. This paper will discuss preparations that were made prior to the introduction of radioactive material, the types of radiological work activities performed, and the hazards and controls encountered. Updates to processes based on actual monitoring results are also discussed.

IMPLEMENTING AN OPERATIONAL PROGRAM FOR DETERMINING THE RADIOLOGICAL STATUS OF MATERIAL AND EQUIPMENT	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						instrumentation; neutron activation; radioactivity, residual; surveys		National Ignition Facility at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory has implemented a protocol for evaluating and releasing material and equipment that is potentially "volumetrically contaminated" as a result of neutron activation and shown not to be "distinguishable from background." This protocol is an important element of the National Ignition Facility's operational program as the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Order 458.1, Radiation Protection of the Public and the Environment, requires DOE approval of the process used to release volumetrically contaminated personal property and establishes a dose constraint of 10 mu Sv y(-1) (1 mrem y(-1)) for clearance of such items. The protocol uses process and historical knowledge to determine when material and equipment may be potentially impacted and field measurements to verify it has been impacted (i.e., is distinguishable from background). Material and equipment that do not meet the distinguishable-from-background criterion are considered to be non-impacted and outside the scope of the Order and may be released from radiological control. This paper provides the technical basis and methodology for determining whether or not there is radioactivity distinguishable from background in the evaluated material and equipment and documents that the measurement sensitivity exceeds the unrestricted release criteria specified in the American National Standards Institute report N13.12-1999, Surface and Volume Radioactivity Standards for Clearance. Pending DOE approval, this protocol could be used as the basis for releasing materials and equipment that exceed the distinguishable-from-background criterion and are below the specified threshold for unrestricted release.

The National Ignition Facility at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory developed a technical basis document and protocol for determining the radiological status of property that is potentially activated from exposure to neutron radiation produced via fusion of tritium and deuterium. The technical basis included assessment of the neutron energy, the type of materials potentially exposed and the likely activation products, and the sensitivity of radiation detectors used to survey the property. This paper evaluates the National Ignition Facility technical basis document for applicability to the release of property from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory's various accelerator facilities considering the different types of particles accelerated, radiations produced, and resultant activation products. Extensive process knowledge regarding the accelerators' operations, accompanied by years of routine surveys, provides an excellent characterization of these facilities. Activation studies conducted at the Stanford Linear Accelerator and the High Energy Accelerator Research Organization in Japan corroborate that the long-lived radionuclides produced at accelerator facilities are of the same variety produced at the National Ignition Facility. Consequently, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory concludes that the release protocol developed for the National Ignition Facility can be used appropriately at all its accelerator facilities.

Based on these demonstration experiments, the Laser Inertial Fusion Energy (LIFE) power plant is being designed at LLNL in partnership with other institutions with the goal to deliver baseload electricity from safe, secure, sustainable fusion power in a time scale that is consistent with the energy market needs. For this purpose, the LIFE design takes advantage of recent advances in diode-pumped, solid-state laser technology and adopts the paradigm of Line Replaceable Units used on the NIF to provide high levels of availability and maintainability and mitigate the need for advanced materials development. The LIFE market entry plant will demonstrate the feasibility of a closed fusion fuel cycle, including tritium breeding, extraction, processing, refueling, accountability, and safety, in a steady-state power-producing device. While many fusion plant designs require large quantities of tritium for startup and operations, a range of design choices made for the LIFE fuel cycle act to reduce the in-process tritium inventory. This paper presents an overview of the delivery plan and the preconceptual design of the LIFE facility with emphasis on the key safety design principles being adopted. In order to illustrate the favorable safety characteristics of the LIFE design, some initial accident analysis results are presented that indicate potential for a more attractive licensing regime than that of current fission reactors.

A well-characterized irradiated UO2 fuel sample dissolved in a hot cell was used as a sample to evaluate the reliability of the methodology. Prior to the ICP-MS measurement, Sn was separated from Te (Te-126), which causes major isobaric interference in the determination of Sn-126 content, along with highly radioactive coexisting elements, such as Sr (Sr-90), Y (Y-90), Cs (Cs-137) and Ba ((137m) Ba), using an anion-exchange column. The absence of counts attributed to Te at m/z = 125, 128, and 130 in the Sn-containing effluent (Sn fraction) indicates that Te was completely removed from the anion-exchange column. After washing, Sn retained on the column was readily eluted with 1M HNO3 accompanied with approximately 80% of the Cd and 0.03% of the U in the initial sample. Owing to the presences of Cd and U in Sn fraction, the measurements of Sn-116 and Sn-119 were affected by the isobaric Cd-116 and the doubly charged (238)U(2+)ion, resulting in the positive bias of the determined values. With the exception of the isotopic ratios including Sn-116 and Sn-119, Sn-117/Sn-126, Sn-118/Sn-126, Sn-120/Sn-126, Sn-122/Sn-126 and Sn-124/Sn-126 were successfully determined and showed good agreement with those obtained through ORIGEN2 calculations. The measured concentration of Sn-126 in the spent nuclear fuel sample solution was 0.74 +/- 0.14ng/g, which corresponds to 23.0 +/- 4.5ng per gram of the irradiated UO2 fuel (excluding the presence of Sn-126 in the insoluble residue). The results reported in this paper are the first experimental values of Sn-126 content and isotope ratios in the spent nuclear fuel solution originating in spent nuclear fuel irradiated at a nuclear power plant in Japan.

However, their operation generates amounts of highly energetic photons from O-18(p, n)F-18 reactions. This reaction posed a health hazard to the public. Chung Shan University Hospital had to increase its 2-deoxy-2-[18F]-fluoro-D-glucose products in 2011 to 11.5times that in 2004 and redesign the self-shielded (CTI) Radioisotope Delivery System (RDS)-111 to meet guild requirements regarding the production of positron emission tomography (PET). This study is the first to evaluate air kerma in a CTI RDS-111 cyclotron center with a thermoluminescent dosimeter (TLD). Air kerma of up to 17.0 +/- 2.8 mGy/mo indicated that heavy leakage of photons penetrated the PET/CT facility. The new L-shaped concrete shield and added d(2) door can adequately protect the public. The minimum detectable limit of air kerma is discussed to demonstrate the reliability of the TLD approach.

The provisional target for proliferation resistance measures based on Saito's attractiveness (ATTR) is defined. It is found that a few percent of plutonium loading and/or Am/Cm loading, which come from various types of spent fuel, might satisfy the provisional target with a minimum impact on the core neutronic performances. On Am/Cm loading core, decay heat constraints for fuel-handling aspects are found to be important and should be considered in design. There is not significant change on the current developing scenarios for light water reactorFBR transition period by applying the measures based on Saito's ATTR. It is found that applying Kimura's proposal, 15% Pu-238 content requires about 7% MA loading fraction both in the core and the blanket, and it only can be applied at limited case. The period to consume minor actinides is shorter than to consume plutonium.

Design of a unique open-geometry cylindrical Penning trap	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Penning; Cylindrical; Precision; Analytic solution	NUCLEAR BETA-DECAY; ACCURACY; TESTS; IONS	The Texas A&M University Penning trap facility is an ion trap system currently under construction, and will be used for precision nuclear physics experiments with radioactive beams provided by the Cyclotron Institute. Its primary focus is to carry out experiments to search for possible scalar currents in T=2 superallowed beta-delayed proton decays, which, if found, would be an indication of physics beyond the standard model. In addition, TAMUTRAP will provide a low-energy, spatially localized source of ions for various other applications. The experiment is centered around a unique, compensated cylindrical Penning trap that employs a specially optimized length/radius ratio in the electrode structure that is not used by any other facility. This allows the electrode structure to exhibit an unprecedented 90 mm inner radius, which is larger than in any existing trap, while at the same time remaining a tractable overall length. The trap geometry was designed from first principles to be suitable for a wide range of nuclear physics experiments. In particular, the electrode structure allows for a near quadrupole electric field at the trap center, a feature necessary for performing precision mass measurements. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

J	Yaar, I; Peysakhov, I				Yaar, Ilan; Peysakhov, Ilya			A multiple-detector Radioactive Material Detection Spectroscopic (RMDS) portal	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Segmented SPM; Border safety; RDD; SNM	HOMELAND SECURITY APPLICATIONS; RADIATION DETECTION; BORDER CROSSINGS; CARGO CONTAINERS; MONITOR; SYSTEMS	This paper describes an optimization process for a Radioactive Material Detection Spectroscopic (RMDS) portal, designed to detect and identify radioactive materials concealed inside cargo containers. The system is based on a combination of conventional 3 in. NaI(Tl) gamma detectors and He-3 neutron detection tubes. The basic concept and the advantages of the new segmented spectroscopic detector approach are presented with several algorithms that were developed to enhance the detection capability of the portal and improve the signal to noise ratio. The results of field tests performed in several locations in Israel are also presented. The RMDS portal fully meets the demands of new ANSI Standard 42.38 for spectroscopic portals. In addition, the portal has some unique features, such as the ability to find the exact location of a point source inside the cargo and the ability to differentiate between a point source and Naturally Occurring Radioactive Materials (NORM) radiation. During the tests, the RMDS portal was compared to other detection systems, such as a PVT-based portal and a handheld spectroscopic HPGe detector. In these tests, the RMDS system was found to have a unique technique for background subtraction, which results in a higher detection sensitivity. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Real-time pulse-shape discrimination and beta-gamma coincidence detection in field-programmable gate array	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Digital signal processing; Pulse shape discrimination; Phoswich detector; Radioxenon measurement; FPGA devices	SPECTROSCOPY; RADIOXENON	A real-time FPGA-based algorithm has been developed and tested to discriminate pulse-shapes, identify beta-gamma coincidence events and collect energy spectra from xenon radioisotopes using a phoswich detector. The detector consists of a thin plastic scintillator (BC-400) to detect beta and conversion electrons, a CsI(Tl) crystal for measuring X-rays and gamma-rays, and a BGO crystal, which surrounds the CsI(Tl) layer, to identify scattered photons and ultimately to reduce Compton continuum in the gamma energy spectrum. In this paper, we report on the detail of the FPGA hardware design, the pulse-shape discrimination method, and the system's operational modes. In addition, our initial real-time radioxenon measurement results with the phoswich detector are presented. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Farsoni, A.

Determination of the plutonium content in a spent fuel assembly by passive and active interrogation using a differential die-away instrument	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Differential die-away; Spent nuclear fuel; Plutonium content		In this paper, we present a novel approach to estimating the total plutonium content in a spent fuel assembly (SFA) that is based on combining information from a passive measurement of the total neutron count rate (PN) of the assayed SFA and a measure of its multiplication. While PN can be measured essentially with any non-destructive assay (NDA) technique capable of neutron detection, the measure of multiplication is, in our approach, determined by means of active interrogation using an instrument based on the Differential Die-Away technique (DDA). The DDA is a NDA technique developed within the U.S. Department of Energy's Next Generation Safeguards Initiative (NGSI) project focused on the utilization of NDA techniques to determine the elemental plutonium content in commercial nuclear SFA's [1]. This approach was adopted since DDA also allows determination of other SFA characteristics, such as burnup, initial enrichment, and cooling time, and also allows for detection of certain types of diversion of nuclear material. The quantification of total plutonium is obtained using an analytical correlation function in terms of the observed PN and active multiplication. Although somewhat similar approaches relating Pu content with PN have been adopted in the past, we demonstrate by extensive simulation of the fuel irradiation and NDA process that our analytical method is independent of explicit knowledge of the initial enrichment, burnup, and an absolute value of the SFA's reactivity (i.e. multiplication factor). We show that when tested with MCNPX (TM) simulations comprising the 64 SFA NGSI Spent Fuel Library-1 we were able to determine elemental plutonium content, using just a few calibration parameters, with an average variation in the prediction of around 1-2% across the wide dynamic range of irradiation history parameters used, namely initial enrichment (IE=2-5%), burnup (BU=15-60 GWd/tU) and cooling time (CT=1-80 y). In this paper we describe the basic approach and the success obtained against synthetic data. We recognize that our synthetic data may not fully capture the rich behavior of actual irradiated fuel and the uncertainties of the practical measurements. However, this design study is based on a rather complete nuclide inventory and the correlations for Pu seem robust to variation of input. Thus it is concluded that the proposed method is sufficiently promising that further experimentally based work is desirable.	[Henzl, V.; Croft, S.; Richard, J.; Swinhoe, M. T.; Tobin, S.

First, the HPGe spectrometer was set-up for running the detector at high count rates while keeping the energy resolution adequately high to discriminate the Cs-137 peak from other interfering peaks. Based on these settings, the geometrical conditions are settled. Next, experiments, were performed with Co-60 and Cs-137 sources to mimic the counting rates in real applications. With the aid of KORIGEN and MCNP/G4 simulations, it was demonstrated that the uncertainty of the Cs-137 counting rate can be well controlled within 3.5%. Finally, a full size prototype was tested in comparison with detailed Monte Carlo simulation and the efficiency transfer method was further utilized for efficiency calibration. To reduce the uncertainty in the efficiency transfer process, a standard point source embedded in a graphite sphere was used for efficiency calibration. The correction factor due to pebble self-attenuation was carefully studied. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Goddard, B; Croft, S				Goddard, Braden; Croft, Stephen			High-fidelity passive neutron multiplicity measurements and simulations of uranium oxide	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Epithermal neutron multiplicity counter (ENMC); Monte Carlo N Particle Extended (MCNPX); Passive neutron multiplicity counting; Uranium nondestructive assay; Point-model; Multiplicity analysis	LIGHT-ELEMENTS	When measuring low-self-multiplication uranium samples by passive neutron multiplicity counting, a technique not commonly used on uranium, there should be a decrease in the doubles counts with increasing enrichment. The reason for this decrease is explained as being due to the reduction in U-238 mass, which has a large specific spontaneous fission rate in comparison to the other naturally occurring uranium isotopes. However, this is an over simplification of the actual nuclear physics which is occurring in bulk oxide items. The neutron multiplicity production rates are affected by many factors, such as the items self-multiplication, uranium isotopic composition which controls the spontaneous fission to (alpha,n) neutron production ratio, and the energy distribution of the emitted neutrons which includes induced fission neutrons. This paper presents a high-fidelity analysis of the passive neutron multiplicity distributions for varying enrichments of known uranium oxide standards. This analysis was performed through physical measurements of standards using the Los Alamos Epithermal Neutron Multiplicity Counter (ENMC) and detailed Monte Carlo N Particle Extended (MCNPX) neutron transport simulations supplemented with best available source term data. The MCNPX simulations reproduced the generic trends observed experimentally but absolute agreement is modest, especially for the triples counting. This suggests improvements in basic nuclear data are needed. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Localization of radiation damages in X-rays irradiated cis-syn-cis-dicyclohexano-18-crown-6 and its inclusion complex with BaCl2	RADIATION PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Dicyclohexano-18-crown-6; Barium chloride; Radiolysis; EPR	ELECTRON-SPIN-RESONANCE; EARTH METAL CHLORIDES; 77 K; 15-CROWN-5 COMPLEXES; GAMMA-RADIOLYSIS; CROWN-ETHERS; CIS-ISOMERS; RADICALS; DICYCLOHEXANO-18-CROWN-6; STABILITY	For the first time, structures of radical intermediates generated upon low temperature (77 K) X-rays radiolysis of "free" dicyclohexano-18-crown-6 (cis-syn-cis-isomer, DCH18C6) and its inclusion complex with barium chloride (DCH18C6 center dot BaCl2) were identified using EPR spectroscopy. A set of radicals originated from polyether and cyclohexyl rings was detected in DCH18C6 center dot BaCl2 complex and "free" crown ether DCH18C6 irradiated at 77 K. Cyclohexyl, macrocyclic -O-(CH)-C-center dot-CH2- and acyclic -(CH)-C-center dot-C(H)=O radicals were suggested to be formed at early stages of radiolysis in both investigated compounds, and the fraction of macrocyclic -O-(CH)-C-center dot-CH2-radicals was predominant immediately after irradiation at 77 K. Additionally, an effect of barium cation on post-radiation reactions of the radicals in irradiated DCH18C6 center dot BaCl2 complex upon its subsequent thermal annealing at temperature above 333 K was found. In particular, the analysis of EPR spectrum of the irradiated complex annealed at 333-413 K implied a presence of signal from acyclic cyclohexanonyl radicals, which may presumably resulted from rearrangement of cyclic alpha-alkoxycyclohexyl radical precursors. This post-radiation reaction may contribute to accumulation of acyclic radiolytic products in the irradiated complex when comparing with radiolysis of free DCH18C6. The results obtained are essential for understanding the peculiarities of radiation resistance of extraction and sorption systems based on the crown ether under real conditions of radioactive waste reprocessing.

The first step was initiated by growth of fungi in the absence of mine waste. Using response surface methodology, three factors were surveyed for fungal growth: initial pH, sucrose concentration and spore population. Also concentrations of oxalic, citric, and gluconic acids were measured as response in this step. During 30 days, maximum productions of these acids were 3265, 11578, and 7988 mg/l, respectively. Initial pH and sucrose concentration were significant factors for oxalic and citric acid production; however, for gluconic acid production sucrose concentration and spore population were significant. Then, the content of each flask was filtered and mine waste was added to liquor with pulp density of 3%. During 3 days, in the second step, vanadium recovered about 44.8% in the liquor.

Variables of the batch experiments were investigated including initial concentration, pH of initial solution, contact time, weight of adsorbent, ionic strength and desorption. The results indicate that the adsorption equilibrium can be reached within 30 min with a saturated adsorption capacity of 203 mg/g at optimum pH of 6 for the fresh calcined SBA-15. According to the coefficients, the isothermal data correlates with the Langmuir model better than the Freundlich model, and the adsorption process follows a pseudo-second order rate equation. Five repeated adsorption-desorption cycles were carried out. The maximum adsorption capacity of SBA-15 in the last four cycles is almost kept at 170 mg/g and achieves equilibrium within 10 min. Therefore, SBA-15 could be as a promising adsorbent to remove uranium ion from aqueous solution with large adsorption capacity, fast adsorption rate and reusability. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The assessment was performed for two cases: an evaluation of the impact that accidental release has on the dose that would be received by public around the reactor in case of proper operation of testing cell filtration system; and an assessment of the potential dose in case of loss of testing cell filtration system. The results show that the filtration system has a great role in decreasing the dose received by an individual located outside the reactor to a dose level lower than the annual permissible dose.

J	Xiao, JJ; Travis, JR				Xiao, Jianjun; Travis, John R.			How critical is turbulence modeling in gas distribution simulations of large-scale complex nuclear reactor containment?	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Computational fluid dynamics (CFD); Turbulence modeling; Hydrogen safety; Nuclear power plant (NPP); Containment	SEVERE ACCIDENTS; FLOW SPEEDS; HYDROGEN; BEHAVIOR	Uncontrolled hydrogen combustion can occur in the nuclear reactor containment during a severe accident. The energetic hydrogen combustion may threaten the integrity of the containment and lead to radioactive material being released into the environment. In order to mitigate the risk of hydrogen combustion, the first step is to understand how the burnable hydrogen cloud develops in the containment. Turbulence modeling is one of the key elements in simulations of the physical phenomena that occur in containment. However, when a turbulence model is used, the computational time is increased in CFD simulations of large-scale reactor containment primarily due to the additional turbulent transport equations and the small time step controlled by the explicitly-treated turbulent diffusion in GASFLOW code. The purpose of this paper is to investigate how critical turbulence modeling is in the simulation of hydrogen/steam distribution in a large-scale, complex reactor containment. In other words, is it acceptable to neglect the turbulent viscosity in the momentum diffusion term in such a large-scale engineering simulation to save computational time? The effect of turbulence models on the gas distribution in the MISTRA 2009 campaign was investigated using the CFD code, GASFLOW. The calculation results improved locally in the region near the jet source when turbulence models were used. For most of the space in the MISTRA facility, which is located away from the source, it seems that the turbulent diffusion was over-predicted by the turbulence models, and better agreements with the experimental data were obtained by simply using molecular viscosity. These results indicate that with turbulence models, more computational time is required, and the improved calculation results are local and limited. It appears that the predictions are reasonably good when only molecular viscosity is considered in the diffusion terms. Due to the limited computational resources, we must investigate the trade-offs between computational effort and accuracy, particularly in large-scale engineering applications. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Plasma Radiofrequency Discharges as Cleaning Technique for the Removal of C-W Coatings	JOURNAL OF FUSION ENERGY			English	Article						C-W mixed materials; Film removal; Erosion rate; RF capacitively coupled plasmas	TRITIUM RETENTION; HYDROCARBON FILMS; STAINLESS-STEEL; TUNGSTEN; CARBON; ENERGY; ION; SURFACES; EROSION; IMPACT	Erosion of materials by chemical and physical sputtering is one of the most concern of plasma wall interaction in tokamaks. In divertor ITER-like tokamaks, where carbon and tungsten are planned to be used, hydrogenated C-W mixed compounds are expected to form by erosion, transport and re-deposition processes. The selection of these materials as divertor components involves lifetime and safety issues due to tritium retention in carbon co-deposits. In this paper a cleaning technique based on RF (13.56 MHz) capacitively coupled H-2/Ar plasmas has been used to remove C-W mixed materials from test specimens. The dependence of the removal rate on the H-2/Ar ratio and on the plasma pressure has been investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, profilometry as regards the solid phase and by Langmuir probe and optical emission spectroscopy as regards the plasma phase. The best result has been obtained with a H-2/Ar ratio of 10/90 at a pressure of 1 Pa. An explanation based on a synergistic effect between physical sputtering due to energetic ions and chemical etching due to radicals, together with the pressure dependence of the ion energy distribution function, is given.

Calculations of (n,alpha) Cross Sections on Some Structural Fusion Materials for Fusion Reactor Technology	JOURNAL OF FUSION ENERGY			English	Article						Empirical formulas; (n,alpha) reaction; Cross-section; Fusion structural materials	PRE-EQUILIBRIUM DECAY; SEMIEMPIRICAL SYSTEMATICS; NUCLEAR-REACTIONS; EXCITON MODEL; CLUSTER EMISSION; PARTICLES; FORMULAS; ELEMENTS; TRITIUM; 2N	The knowledge of cross section for emission of light charged particles (p, d, t, and alpha) induced by fast neutrons on structural fusion materials has a critical importance on fusion reactors. The gas production arising from (n,p) and (n,alpha) reactions causes seriously radiation damage in fusion reactor structure. The radiation damage in fusion related materials is a large problem need to be overcome for development of fusion reactor technology. Particularly, the (n,alpha) reaction cross section data are required to estimation of the radiation damage effects on structural fusion materials. Therefore, the cross section data for (n,alpha) reaction induced by fast neutrons are of increasing importance for the success of future fusion reactors. In this study, reaction model calculations of the cross sections of neutron induced reactions on structural fusion materials such as (29) Si, (30) Si, (48) Ti, (50) Ti, (50) Cr, (54) Cr, (54) Fe and (58) Fe have been investigated. The new calculations on the excitation functions of (29) Si (n,alpha) (26) Mg, (30) Si (n,alpha) (27) Mg, (48) Ti (n,alpha) (45) Ca, (50) Ti (n,alpha) (47) Ca, (50) Cr (n,alpha) (47) Ti, (54) Cr (n,alpha) (51) Ti, (54) Fe (n,alpha) (51) Cr and (58) Fe (n,alpha) (55) Cr have been carried out for incident neutron energies up to 30 MeV. In these calculations, the pre-equilibrium and equilibrium effects for (n,alpha) reactions have been investigated. The pre-equilibrium calculations involve the new evaluated the geometry dependent hybrid model, hybrid model and the cascade exciton model. The equilibrium effects of the excitation functions for the investigated reactions are calculated according to the Weisskopf-Ewing model. Also in the present work, the (n,alpha) reaction cross sections have calculated by using evaluated empirical formulas developed by Tel et al. at 14-15 MeV energy. The calculated results have been discussed and compared with the available experimental data and found agreement with each other.

J	Perrault, D				Perrault, D.			ITER Creation Safety File Expertise Results	JOURNAL OF FUSION ENERGY			English	Article						ITER; Safety; Design; Risks; Accidents; Wastes		In March 2010, the ITER operator delivered the facility safety file to the French "Autorit, de SA >> ret, Nucl,aire" (ASN) as part of its request for the creation decree, legally necessary before building works can begin on the site. The French "Institut de Radioprotection et de SA >> ret, Nucl,aire" (IRSN), in support to the ASN, recently completed its expertise of the safety measures proposed for ITER, on the basis of this file and of additional technical documents from the operator. This paper presents the IRSN's main conclusions. In particular, they focus on the radioactive materials involved, the safety and radiation protection demonstration (suitability of risk management measuresaEuro broken vertical bar), foreseeable accidents, building and safety important component design and, finally, wastes and effluents to be produced. This assessment was just the first legally-required step in on-going safety monitoring of the ITER project, which will include other complete regulatory re-evaluations.

Characterization of low temperature metallic magnetic calorimeters having gold absorbers with implanted Ho-163 ions	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Neutrino mass; Ho-163; Electron capture; Low temperature detectors; Ion-implantation	NEUTRINO MASS	For the first time we have investigated the behavior of fully micro-fabricated low temperature metallic magnetic calorimeters (MMCs) after undergoing an ion-implantation process. This experiment had the aim to show the possibility to perform a high precision calorimetric measurement of the energy spectrum following the electron capture of Ho-163 using MMCs having the radioactive Ho-163 ions implanted in the absorber. The isotope Ho-163 decays through electron capture to Dy-163 and features the smallest known Q(EC) value. This peculiarity makes Ho-163 a very interesting candidate to investigate the value of the electron neutrino mass by the analysis of the energy spectrum. The implantation of Ho-163 ions was performed at ISOLDE-CERN. The performance of a detector that underwent an ion-implantation process is compared to the one of a detector without implanted ions. The results show that the implantation dose of ions used in this experiment does not compromise the properties of the detector. Moreover the performance of the detector prototype having the Ho-163 ions implanted in the absorber is already close to the requirements needed for an experiment with sub-eV sensitivity to the electron neutrino mass. Based on these results, an optimized detector design for future Ho-163 experiments is presented. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Gastaldo, L.; Ranitzsch, P.

Toward a new polyethylene scattering law determined using inelastic neutron scattering	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						MCNP; Neutron transport; Inelastic neutron scattering; Density of states; NJOY; Polyethylene	PARTIALLY CRYSTALLINE POLYETHYLENE; FREQUENCY MOLECULAR-MODES; DEBYE-WALLER FACTOR; CROSS-SECTION; SOLID DEUTERIUM; MULTIPLE-SCATTERING; RESOLUTION FUNCTION; THERMAL MODERATOR; PERFORMANCE; SPECTRUM	Monte Carlo neutron transport codes such as MCNP rely on accurate data for nuclear physics cross-ections to produce accurate results. At low energy, this takes the form of scattering laws based on the dynamic structure factor, S(Q,E). High density polyethylene (HDPE) is frequently employed as a neutron moderator at both high and low temperatures, however the only cross-sections available are for ambient temperatures (similar to 300 K), and the evaluation has not been updated in quite some time. In this paper we describe inelastic neutron scattering measurements on HDPE at 5 and 294 K which are used to improve the scattering law for HDPE. We review some of the past HDPE scattering laws, describe the experimental methods, and compare computations using these models to the measured S(Q,E). The total cross-section is compared to available data, and the treatment of the carbon secondary scatterer as a free gas is assessed. We also discuss the use of the measurement itself as a scattering law via the one phonon approximation. We show that a scattering law computed using a more detailed model for the Generalized Density of States (GDOS) compares more favorably to this experiment, suggesting that inelastic neutron scattering can play an important role in both the development and validation of new scattering laws for Monte Carlo work.

Therefore, fundamental understanding of gas bubble evolution kinetics is essential to predict the thermodynamic property and performance changes of fuels. In this work, a generic phase-field model was developed to describe the evolution kinetics of intragranular fission gas bubbles in UO2 fuels under postirradiation thermal annealing conditions. Free energy functional and model parameters are evaluated from atomistic simulations and experiments. Critical nucleus size of gas bubbles and gas bubble evolution were simulated. A linear relationship between logarithmic bubble number density and logarithmic mean bubble diameter was predicted, which is in good agreement with experimental data. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Inside vacancy space, He prefers to occupy octahedral site rather than vacancy center, different from of the cases of bcc Fe and W. Equilibrium He-H (2.33 angstrom) and H-H (2.45 angstrom) distances in the vacancy are longer than He-He distance (1.75 angstrom) and they exhibit a weak attraction. One He-vacancy complex can trap up to five H atoms and the stable configurations with different amount of trapped H atoms are discussed in details. If a He atom occupies vacancy center, formation of H-2 molecule in the He-vacancy complex is almost impossible. Moreover, formation energy of a new vacancy around the H-He-vacancy complex does not remarkably reduce with increasing number of H atoms. We thus suggest that creation of a new vacancy around the He-complex via H aggregation is thermodynamically difficult. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A Compton-vetoed germanium detector with increased sensitivity at low energies	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Isotope analysis; Germanium detectors; Compton veto; Background suppression; Spent fuel analysis; Plutonium detection		The difficulty to directly detect plutonium in spent nuclear fuel due to the high Compton background of the fission products motivates the design of a gamma detector with improved sensitivity at low energies. We have built such a detector by operating a thin high-purity Ge detector with a large scintillator Compton veto directly behind it. The Ge detector is thin to absorb just the low-energy Pu radiation of interest while minimizing Compton scattering of high-energy radiation from the fission products. The subsequent scintillator is large so that forward-scattered photons from the Ge detector interact in it at least once to provide an anti-coincidence veto for the Ge detector. For highest sensitivity, additional material in the line of sight is minimized, the radioactive sample is kept thin, and its radiation is collimated. We will discuss the instrument design, and demonstrate the feasibility of the approach with a prototype that employs two large CsI scintillator vetoes. Initial spectra of a thin Cs-137 calibration source show a background suppression of a factor of similar to 2.5 at similar to 100 keV, limited by an unexpectedly thick 4 mm dead layer in the Ge detector.

Measurement of non-separated U/Pu samples: optimization of TIMS procedures for safeguards purposes at Rokkasho on-site laboratory	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Thermal ionization mass spectrometry; Plutonium isotope ratio; Un-separated U/Pu samples; On-site laboratory	IONIZATION MASS-SPECTROMETRY; ISOTOPE RATIO MEASUREMENTS; URANIUM; PLUTONIUM	The on-site laboratory (OSL) at Rokkasho Reprocessing Plant (RRP) is jointly operated by the Japanese authority Nuclear Material Control Centre and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and provides, together with the Nuclear Material Laboratory (NML) at Seibersdorf, analytical services to the IAEA's inspectorate. OSL deals with a variety of samples typical to a reprocessing plant including pure product solutions of uranium and plutonium but also mixed U/Pu solutions originating from various stages of the chemical process. For a significant proportion of the samples, the requirement on measurement accuracy and precision from the Inspectorate makes the use of thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS) indispensible. Until recently, all samples intended for TIMS had to undergo time-consuming U/Pu separation before isotope dilution measurement. The need for rapid reporting of analytical results for certain safeguards samples evoked the idea of performing TIMS measurements without prior U/Pu separation for mixed U/Pu products as they are obtained from the PUREX process at RRP. For this purpose, a systematic study was initiated to probe the figure of merits and limitations of conducting TIMS analyses on mixed U/Pu samples and, in particular, whether the accuracy and precision of the main ratios of interest, n(U-235)/n(U-238) and n(Pu-240)/n(Pu-239), are influenced by the presence of larger amounts of the other element. A series of synthetic mixtures with U/Pu ratios ranging from 1:10 up to 100:1 were prepared and measured in both laboratories-OSL and NML-using ThermoFisher TRITON multi-collector TIMS instruments. For the n(U-235)/n(U-238) ratio, interference due to Pu-238 was observed which can be significant depending on the U/Pu ratio and the Pu-238 abundance. However, for the n(Pu-240)/n(Pu-239) ratio, which is of premier importance for safeguarding RRP, no significant interference arising from the concomitant U was detected independently of enrichment. Even in samples with an excess of U (U/Pu ratio of 100:1), compliance with International Target Values (ITV2010) was demonstrated for n(Pu-240)/n(Pu-239) results with a relative difference to certified not exceeding 0.01 %.

The chosen protocol (AG1x8 resin in hydrochloric acid medium) has been tested on separation microcolumns (100 mu l). This 'microchemistry' technique considerably limits the risks of contamination by reagents or the environment. Thorium extraction efficiencies were greater than 90 % and reproducible. The quantities of Th-230 introduced by the chemical purification procedure were negligible. Using an ultra-sensitive inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry measurement technique, detection limits of the order of femtograms (10(-15) g) of Th-230 were obtained. The complete procedure, chemical separation and isotope measurement, was successfully tested and validated on a few micrograms of uranium.

Round-robins in the area of uranium and plutonium bulk analysis of environmental samples	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Uranium; Plutonium; Round-robin; Inter-comparison; Swipe samples; Bulk analysis	ICP-MS; URINE	In the framework of a collaboration between laboratories involved in bulk U and Pu analysis of environmental samples (DIF centre of the French Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique, US National Laboratories of New Brunswick, Lawrence Livermore, Pacific Northwest, Oak Ridge, and Los Alamos), two round-robins were organised, each one consisting of the complete analysis (chemical preparation and isotope measurement) of three Quality Control samples. The samples were 10 x 10 cm cotton tissues ("swipe samples") containing low amounts of U (from similar to 20 to similar to 150 ng) and Pu (from similar to 0.15 to similar to 10 pg). Despite using different spikes, different methods of sample preparation and different analytical instrumentation, the results for U and Pu contents and isotopic compositions reported by all laboratories are globally in good agreement. All laboratories are able to measure sub-pg amounts of U and Pu isotopes with acceptable accuracy and reproducibility, even if limited discrepancies are observed affecting one or other measurement and/or laboratory. General and laboratory specific recommendations were discussed and adopted to continue to improve the accuracy and precision of the measurements.

J	Pointurier, F; Hubert, A; Pottin, AC				Pointurier, Fabien; Hubert, Amelie; Pottin, Anne-Claire			Performance of laser ablation: quadrupole-based ICP-MS coupling for the analysis of single micrometric uranium particles	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Laser ablation; ICP-MS; Particles; Uranium; Fission tracks; Particle analysis	ION MASS-SPECTROMETRY; ISOTOPIC ANALYSIS; SWIPE SAMPLES; RATIO	In this paper we describe the application of laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) coupling to particle analysis, i.e., the determination of the isotopic composition of micrometric uranium particles. The performances of this analysis technique are compared with those of the two reference particle analysis techniques: secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) and fission track-thermo-ionization mass spectrometry (FT-TIMS), based on the measurement of the isotopic ratios of U-235/U-238 in particles present in an inter-comparison particulate sample. The agreement of the results obtained using LA-ICP-MS with target values and with the results obtained using FT-TIMS and SIMS was good. Accuracy was equivalent to that of the other two techniques (+/- 3 % deviation). However, relative experimental uncertainties present with LA-ICP-MS (7 %) were higher than those present with FT-TIMS (4.5 %) and SIMS (3 %). Furthermore, measurement yield of LA-ICP-MS coupling was close to that obtained with the same quadrupole ICP-MS for the measurement of a liquid sample (similar to 10(-4)), but lower than that obtained with FT-TIMS and SIMS, respectively, by a factor of 10 and 20, although the particles analyzed using LA-ICP-MS were most likely smaller (diameter similar to 0.6 mu m, containing 4-7 fg of U-235). Nevertheless, thanks to the brevity of the signals obtained, the detection capacity for low isotopic concentrations by LA-ICP-MS coupling is equivalent to that of FT-TIMS, although it remains well below that of SIMS (x15). However, with more sensitive double focusing ICP-MS, performances equivalent to those achieved using SIMS could be obtained.

Geant4 model validation of Compton suppressed system for process monitoring of spent fuel	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Compton suppression; Spent fuel; Geant4; Reprocessing; Process monitor	COINCIDENCE-SUMMING CORRECTIONS; GAMMA-RAY SPECTROMETRY	Nuclear material accountancy is of continuous concern for the regulatory, safeguards, and verification communities. In particular, spent nuclear fuel reprocessing facilities pose one of the most difficult accountancy challenges: monitoring highly radioactive, fluid sample streams in near real-time. The Multi-Isotope Process monitor will allow for near-real-time indication of process alterations using passive gamma-ray detection coupled with multivariate analysis techniques to guard against potential material diversion or to enhance domestic process monitoring. The Compton continuum from the dominant 661.7 keV Cs-137 fission product peak obscures lower energy lines which could be used for spectral and multivariate analysis. Compton suppression may be able to mitigate the challenges posed by the high continuum caused by scattering. A Monte Carlo simulation using the Geant4 toolkit is being developed to predict the expected suppressed spectrum from spent fuel samples to estimate the reduction in the Compton continuum. Despite the lack of timing information between decay events in the particle management of Geant4, encouraging results were recorded utilizing only the information within individual decays without accounting for accidental coincidences. The model has been validated with single and cascade decay emitters in two steps: as an unsuppressed system and with suppression activated. Results of the Geant4 model validation will be presented.

Intrinsic dosimetry of glass containers: a potential interrogation tool for nuclear forensics and waste management	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Glass; Intrinsic dosimetry; Thermoluminescence; Nuclear forensics	OPTICALLY STIMULATED LUMINESCENCE; GAMMA-IRRADIATED PYREX; SILICATE-GLASSES; IRON; ELECTRON; RADIATION; RESONANCE; DEFECTS; BOROSILICATE; COORDINATION	Intrinsic dosimetry is the method of measuring total absorbed dose received by the walls of a container holding radioactive material. By considering the total absorbed dose received by a container in tandem with the physical characteristics of the radioactive material housed within that container, this method has the potential to provide enhanced pathway information regarding the history of the container and its radioactive contents. We report the latest in a series of experiments designed to validate and demonstrate this newly developed tool. Thermoluminescence (TL) dosimetry was used to measure dose effects on raw stock borosilicate container glass up to 70 days after gamma ray, X-ray, beta particle or ultraviolet irradiations at doses from 0.15 to 20 Gy. Two main peaks were identified in the TL glow curve when irradiated with Co-60, a relatively unstable peak around 120 degrees C and a more stable peak around 225 degrees C. Signal strength of both peaks decayed with time. The minimum measurable dose using this technique is 0.15 Gy, which is roughly equivalent to a 24 h irradiation at 1 cm from a 50 ng Co-60 source. As a result of fading, this dose would be detectable for approximately 1 year post-irradiation. In a more detailed analysis, the TL glow curves were separated into five peaks centered near 120, 160, 225, 300, and 340 degrees C. Differences in TL glow curve shape and intensity were observed for the glasses from different geographical origins. These differences can be explained by changes in the intensities of the five peaks. This suggests that mechanisms controlling radiation induced defect formation from gamma, beta, X-ray, and UV sources may be similar.

Radiochronological age of a uranium metal sample from an abandoned facility	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Nuclear forensics; Uranium metal; Age dating; Thorium; MC-ICP-MS	PLASMA-MASS SPECTROMETRY; ICP-MS; ENVIRONMENTAL-SAMPLES; ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION; GAMMA-SPECTROMETRY; DEPLETED URANIUM; SOIL SAMPLES; RATIOS; PLUTONIUM; THORIUM	A piece of scrap uranium metal bar buried in the dirt floor of an old, abandoned metal rolling mill was analyzed using multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (MC-ICP-MS). The mill rolled uranium rods in the 1940 and 1950s. Samples of the contaminated dirt in which the bar was buried were also analyzed. The isotopic composition of uranium in the bar and dirt samples were both the same as natural uranium, though a few samples of dirt also contained recycled uranium; likely a result of contamination with other material rolled at the mill. The time elapsed since the uranium metal bar was last purified can be determined by the in-growth of the isotope Th-230 from the decay of U-234, assuming that only uranium isotopes were present in the bar after purification. The age of the metal bar was determined to be 61 years at the time of this analysis and corresponds to a purification date of July 1950 +/- 1.5 years.

Silicon detectors have a number of potential advantages over these detectors (high resolution, low background, sensitive to photons and electrons) and are explored in this work as a possible alternative. Using energy resolutions from measurements and detection efficiencies from simulations of characteristic electron and photon energies, the minimum detectable concentration for Xe isotopes was estimated for several possible detector geometries.

Recent developments in the manufacture of (173)lutetium targets	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Lutetium; Hafnium; Separation; Neutron cross section; Target; Irradiation		To better model nuclear processes there is an interest in measuring neutron capture cross sections of lanthanide radioisotopes. A natural hafnium target was irradiated with 100 meV protons at the Los Alamos Isotope Production Facility at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE) to produce neutron poor lutetium radioisotopes. After irradiation, the target was allowed to cool to allow shorter lived lutetium isotopes to decay. This left predominately Lu-173 with small amounts of Lu-174. The hafnium target was then chemically processed to isolate the lanthanide fraction through ion exchange techniques. Recent efforts have focused on the separation of lanthanide species to produce an elementally pure lutetium product, the manufacture of small high density lutetium targets, and neutron capture cross section measurements.

Often the accuracy of the measurement is directly tied to how well the detector is calibrated, in both energy and efficiency. Standard methods often rely on using certified sealed sources to determine the absolute efficiency. Similarly, efforts to calibrate the absolute efficiency of radioactive gas cell detectors utilize a number of methodologies which allow adequate calibration but are time consuming and prone to a host of difficulties to determine uncertainties (McIntyre et al, J Radioanal Nucl Chem 282(3):755-759, 2009; Anderson et al, Stat Probab Lett 77(88):769-773, 2007). Utilizing methods developed in the 1960s for absolute measurements of activity with beta-gamma detector systems it has become clear that it is possible to achieve higher precision results that are consistent across a range of isotopes and activities (National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurement, A handbook of radioactivity measurements procedure NCPR report, 1985). Even more compelling is the ease with which this process can be used on routine samples to determine the total activity present in the detector. Additionally, recent advances in the generation of isotopically pure radio-xenon samples of Xe-131m, Xe-133, and Xe-135 allow these measurement techniques to achieve much better results than have previously been possible when using mixed isotopic radio-xenon sources (Haas et al, J Radioanal Nucl Chem 282(3):677-680, 2009). This paper will discuss the beta/gamma absolute detection efficiency techniques of direct measurement of the efficiencies and the extrapolation method and compare the results using modeled and measured pure sources of Xe-133 and Xe-135.

Elucidating the radical kinetics involved in the radiolytic destruction of lanthanide-complexed DTPA	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Radiolysis; DTPA; Free radicals; Radiation chemistry; Metal-complexed ligands; Rate constants	PULSE-RADIOLYSIS	The reprocessing of nuclear fuels to extract the remaining actinides is one of the most important strategies for viable nuclear power in the future, as geologic waste disposal of high-level radioactive waste could have considerable negative impacts on the environment. As many of these strategies are based on solvent extraction processes, our aim is to establish the radiolytic stability of the component extraction ligands. The oxidative stability of the lanthanide metal-complexed extraction ligand DTPA (diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid) has been investigated through its reaction rate constant with the hydroxyl radical under TALSPEAK acidic pH conditions, both for the free ligand and complexed with Eu3+, Lu3+ and Gd3+. Specific rate constants were obtained over a range of pH conditions using thiocyanate competition kinetics. The rate constants for the complexed metals are seen to be greater than the corresponding values determined for only the DTPA protonated ligands at these pHs.

It is a liquid-liquid extraction process that aims at extracting all the actinides as a group from dissolved used nuclear fuel. This extraction can either be performed after a removal of the bulk uranium or directly on the dissolution liquor. At Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden a solvent that utilizes tributyl-phosphate (TBP) and a molecule from the bis-triazine bipyridine (BTBP) class of ligands dissolved in cyclohexanone has been developed for the use in a GANEX process. Previously the system has not been tested with the presence of technetium that is one of the major fission products. Technetium is often considered a problem within reprocessing since it has a chemical behaviour that differs from most other elements in the spent fuel. Therefore, a special emphasis was put on the investigation of technetium in the selected GANEX system. It was shown that technetium is readily extracted by the GANEX solvent and that cyclohexanone is the main extractant when no other metals were present in the system. It was also found that the presence of uranium decreased the overall technetium extraction despite a slight co-extraction with TBP, while irradiation of the GANEX solvent to large doses ([>1 MGy) increased its technetium extraction capability. It was also discovered that an increased nitrate concentration in the aqueous phase and an addition of other fission products both inhibited the technetium extraction even though fission product loading most likely changed the extraction mechanism to co-extraction by BTBP.

Determination of uranium fission interference factors for INAA	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Neutron activation analysis; Uranium fission product interferences; Correction factors	NEUTRON-ACTIVATION ANALYSIS; SPECTRAL INTERFERENCES	Instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) is a very suitable technique for the determination of several elements in different kinds of matrices. However, when the sample contains high uranium concentration this method presents interference problems of uranium fission products. The same radioisotopes used in INAA are formed in uranium fission. Among these radioisotopes are Ce-141, Ce-143, La-140, Mo-99, Nd-147, Sm-153 and Zr-95. The purpose of this study was to evaluate uranium fission interference factors to be used in the INAA of environmental and geological samples containing high levels of U. The obtained interference factors agreed with literature reported values. The results point to the viability of using these experimentally determined interference factors for the correction of uranium fission products.	[Ribeiro, I. S., Jr.; Genezini, F.

Fission yield measurements from highly enriched uranium irradiated inside a boron carbide capsule	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Fission product yields; Spectral tailoring; Boron carbide; Radiochemical separations	SPECTRUM	A boron carbide capsule was previously designed and tested by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) and Washington State University (WSU) for spectral-tailoring in mixed spectrum reactors. The presented work used this B4C capsule to create a fission product sample from the irradiation of highly enriched uranium (HEU) with a fast fission neutron spectrum. An HEU foil was irradiated inside of the capsule in WSU's 1 MWTRIGA reactor at full power for 200 min to produce 5.8 x 10(13) fissions. After 3 days of cooling, the sample was shipped to PNNL for radiochemical separations and analysis by gamma and beta spectroscopy. Fission yields for products were calculated from the radiometric measurements and compared to measurements from thermal neutron induced fission (analyzed in parallel with the non-thermal sample at PNNL) and published evaluated fast-pooled and thermal nuclear data.

Simulating a radioactive environment to train and exercise sampling and sample characterization methods with suitable sample materials is a continued challenge. The Idaho National Laboratory has developed and permitted a radioactive response training range (RRTR), an 800 acre test range that is approved for open air dispersal of activated KBr, for training first responders in the entry and exit from radioactively contaminated areas, and testing protocols for environmental sampling and field characterization. Members from the Department of Defense, Law Enforcement, and the Department of Energy participated in the first contamination exercise that was conducted at the RRTR in the July 2011. The range was contaminated using a short lived radioactive Br-82 isotope (activated KBr). Soil samples contaminated with KBr (dispersed as a solution) and glass particles containing activated potassium bromide that emulated dispersed radioactive materials (such as ceramic-based sealed source materials) were collected to assess environmental sampling and characterization techniques. This presentation summarizes the performance of a radioactive materials surrogate for use as a training aide for nuclear forensics.

Reducing measurement uncertainty in Ni-63 measurements in reactor coolant water with high Co-60 activities	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Ni-63; Co-60; Reactor coolant water; Measurement; Uncertainty	NUCLEAR-WASTE SAMPLES; FE-55	In methods for quantification of Ni-63, in e. g. reactor coolant water, a chemical separation is required due to Ni-63 being a pure beta emitter with limited means of quantification. Co-60, a common radionuclide in reactor coolant water, is not completely separated with the commonly used separation procedure, and it is not resolved from Ni-63 in the beta spectrum. The separation method discussed in this work consists of TRU resin (Eichrom) and Ni resin (Eichrom). After running the separation procedure, depending on the initial activity of Co-60, there may still remain enough Co-60 to interfere in the measurement of Ni-63. The Co-60 interference is corrected for via a gamma spectrometric measurement. This correction may, depending on the Ni-63/Co-60 ratio, introduce a large contribution to the measurement uncertainty. The aim of this work was to evaluate the possibility to reduce the measurement uncertainty of Ni-63 measurements by adding a second Ni separation to the method. Double Ni separations were performed on reactor coolant water having a Co-60 activity much higher than the Ni-63 activity (Ni-63/Co-60 = 0.01), in order to decrease the radioactivity of Co-60 in the sample. The measurement uncertainty of the Ni-63 measurement result was reduced by a factor of about three.

In the weeks following the fire, heavy rainfall caused extensive flooding and erosion of surface soil and ash from the affected areas. Samples from mud and ash flows were collected and analyzed for Cs-137 and Pu, which were originally deposited as global fallout during the era of atmospheric nuclear testing. The mean concentrations for Pu-238, Pu-239,Pu-240 and Cs-137 were 0.18 +/- 0.05, 4.16 +/- 1.95, and 111 +/- 56 mBq/g, respectively. Pu-239,Pu-240 and Cs-137 are significantly elevated above non-fire affected regional background levels.
