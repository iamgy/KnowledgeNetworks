As a result of an accidental melting of a Cs-137 source in a Spanish steel mill (Acerinox) in 1998, the national authorities, the involved private companies, and the main trade unions drafted a protocol for prevention of and responding to such events ("Spanish Protocol"). The Protocol was signed in 1999. The number of subscribing companies is 90. The Protocol is a voluntary agreement defining the radiological surveillance of scrap metal and its products and the duties and rights of the signatories. From the effective date of the Protocol to December 2004, 461 pieces of ferric scrap were detected including sources of radiation and contaminated metal. Four melting incidents have happened in different companies.

The Washington site only accepts low-level radioactive waste from 11 western states due to interstate Compact restrictions on waste importation. The South Carolina site Nvill be subject to geographic service area restrictions beginning 1 July 2008, after which only three states will have continued access. The Utah site dominates the commercial Class-A and mixed waste disposal market due to generally lower state fees than apply in South Carolina. To expand existing commercial services, an existing hazardous waste site in western Texas is seeking a Class-A, -B and -C and mixed waste disposal license. With that exception, no new Compact facilities are proposed. This fluid, uncertain situation has inspired national level rulemaking initiatives and policy studies, as well as alternative disposal practices for certain low-activity materials.

Some of these events were catastrophic and have cost the industry millions of dollars in business and, at the same time, resulted in declining consumer confidence. It is also known that more events with confirmed radioactive contamination have occurred that involve mining of old steel slag and skull dumps. Consequently, the steel industry has since undergone massive changes that incurred unprecedented expenses through the installation of radiation monitoring systems in hopes of preventing another accidental melt. Despite such extraordinary efforts, accidental melts continue to occur and plague the industry. One recent reported/confirmed event occurred in the Republic of China in 2004, causing the usual lengthy shutdown for expensive decontamination efforts before the steel mill could resume operations. With this perspective in mind, the metal industry has a long-standing opposition to the release of radioactive materials of any. kind to commerce for fear of contamination and the potential consequences.

Despite the recent market increase in demand for recycled scrap metal commodities, there is still little change in the behavior of the nuclear industry (including radioactive waste processors and radioactive scrap metal recyclers) to pursue the recycling of potentially contaminated scrap metal. The relatively low cost of traditional radioactive waste disposal combined with the perceived risks associated with recycling of previously contaminated metals means that most U.S. radioactive facility managers and stakeholders will elect not to recycle. Current technology exists and precedence has been set for prescreening (by means of bulk radioactive assay techniques) scrap metal that is not contaminated and diverting it to industrial landfills for disposal. Other processes also allow some radiologically contaminated metals to be melted and recast into products with low, but acceptable, activity levels for restricted use in the nuclear industry. A new concept is being considered that would create a centralized licensed facility for the process and disposition of "very-low-activity" metals for "directed first use." The advantages to this type of approach would include a standardized method for licensing the clearance process.

Sites like Rocky Flats, Battelle Columbus Laboratories, Fernald, Mound, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Hanford, and Oak Ridge are faced daily with decisions related to disposition of waste and radioactive material. One key to this success is the disposition of waste arising from cleanup. Most of the generated waste volume has very low levels of radioactive contamination. The waste includes contaminated soil, debris from demolition, or scrap metal and equipment. The cost of disposing of large volumes of waste can be prohibitive, so there is incentive to find innovative ways to disposition wastes. This paper describes the current status of policy development in this area, such as development of a draft programmatic environmental impact statement and monitoring of related rulemaking at the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The paper also provides an overview of draft U.S. DOE guidance on control and release of property with residual radioactive material, and site-specific applications of DOE guidance.

Keith			An analysis of public-interest group positions on radiation protection	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	41st Annual Meeting of the National-Council-on-Radiation-Protection-and-Measurements	MAR 30-31, 2005	Arlington, VA	Natl Council Radiat Protect & Measurement		National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements; radiation risk; public information; waste, low-level	RISK; PARTICIPATION	The history of radiation risk management is replete with contentious public debate between public interest groups and the technical community of radiation protection professionals. To promote a deeper understanding of this phenomenon, this paper describes the rationales and values underlying public-interest group positions in one radiation risk domain (low-level waste) and contrasts them with those of the technical community. Public interest group objections to recycling of radioactivity-contaminated materials and to discarding of other low-level wastes are made on fairness, risk assessment, and energy-policy grounds. Concerns about procedural fairness stem from the continuing use of top-down expert-driven, rather than deliberative, systems for low-level waste policymaking. Concerns about distributional fairness arise because the benefits and risks of alterative low-level waste policies accrue to different stakeholders. Risk assessment is faulted for failure to acknowledge hidden subjective assumptions (e.g., on screening vigilance in materials recycling, on integrity of disposal facilities in the far future). Skepticism of technological risk management arises from a history peppered with unexpected untoward events that lay outside the design bases of protection systems. Finally, public interest groups view lowlevel waste issues as part of a larger debate on wise and legitimate energy policy, and are reluctant to support measures that provide relief to a nuclear industry that, in their view, established itself outside the democratic process.

Unfortunately, there is no general consensus among these industries on the multiple policy issues that are critical to the application of an effective management and disposal program. This paper discusses the various policy issues that affect these industries and the problems that will likely occur during the course of their activities. These policy issues include public and political concern, opposition, and reaction; multiple and sometimes conflicting government agency jurisdiction, regulation, and policy; issues relating to the transition to a new comprehensive system; conflicts between the interests of the various industry groups; and operational, radiation safety, and regulatory implementation issues. For these reasons, the acceptable options may be limited. Case studies of various waste streams are included to show the specific impact and problems that these issues can create.

One or the uses of radium in the first half of the twentieth century was as a source of energy that would make certain consumer products "glow in the dark." In addition to wristwatches and other timepieces, this form of self-luminescence was widely used on aircraft instruments. There have been a number of facilities where large numbers of such instruments were stored and leakage of this isotope occurred. Subsequent decontamination of these areas, including expensive disposal of the radioactive waste, was required. We were asked to evaluate the potential hazards of aircraft and aircraft instruments at a museum in New York City, specifically the decommissioned aircraft carrier USS Intrepid. We present the results of our investigation and discuss the implications as they relate to the proposed new U.S. NRC regulations and compatibility issues with State regulations.

A security vulnerabilities assessment tool for interim storage facilities of low-level radioactive wastes	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						operational topic; safety standards; waste management; waste; low-level	RATIONAL CHOICE; TERRORISM	Limited permanent low-level radioactive waste (LLRW) disposal capacity and correspondingly high disposal costs have resulted in the creation of numerous interim storage facilities for either decay-in-storage operations or longer term accumulation efforts. These facilities, which may be near the site of waste generation or in distal locations, often were not originally designed for the purpose of LLRW storage, particularly with regard to security. Facility security has become particularly important in light of the domestic terrorist acts of 2001, wherein LLRW, along with many other sources of radioactivity, became recognized commodities to those wishing to create disruption through the purposeful dissemination of radioactive materials. Since some LLRW materials may be in facilities that may exhibit varying degrees of security control sophistication, a security vulnerabilities assessment tool grounded in accepted criminal justice theory and security practice has been developed. The tool, which includes dedicated sections on general security, target hardening, criminalization benefits, and the presence of guardians, can be used by those not formally schooled in the security profession to assess the level of protection afforded to their respective facilities. The tool equips radiation safety practitioners with the ability to methodically and systematically assess the presence or relative status of various facility security aspects, many of which may not be considered by individuals from outside the security profession. For example, radiation safety professionals might not ordinarily consider facility lighting aspects, which is a staple for the security profession since it is widely known that crime disproportionately occurs more frequently at night or in poorly lit circumstances. Likewise, the means and associated time dimensions for detecting inventory discrepancies may not be commonly considered. The tool provides a simple means for radiation safety professionals to assess, and perhaps enhance in a reasonable fashion, the security of their interim storage operations. Aspects of the assessment tool can also be applied to other activities involving the protection of sources of radiation as well.

The experiment consists of two series of tests: preliminary evaporation tests for homologue element tellurium (Te) in LBE, and evaporation tests for Po-210-accurnulated LBE in which test specimens are prepared by neutron irradiation. The evaporation tests of Te in LBE provide the suggestion that Te exists in a chemical form of PbTe as well as the information for confirming the validity of technique and conditions of Po test. From the evaporation tests of Po-210 in LBE, we obtain fundamental data and empirical equations Such as Po-210 vapor concentration in the gas phase, Po-210 partial vapor pressure, thermodynamic activity coefficients, and gas-liquid equilibrium partition coefficients of Po-210 in LBE in the temperature range from 450 to 750 degrees C. Additionally, radioactivity concentration of Po-210 and Bi-210 vapor in a cover gas region of a typical LBE-cooled unclear system is specifically estimated based on the obtained experimental results, and the importance of Po-210 evaporation behavior is quantitatively demonstrated.

J	Talamo, A				Talamo, Alberto			Studies on the feasibility of the LWRs waste-thorium in-core fuel cycle in the gas turbine-modular helium reactor	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						GT-MHR; TRISO; waste; thorium; fertile; MCB; gas-cooled; graphite-moderated	COOLED REACTORS; MONTE-CARLO; PARTICLES; JENDL-3.3	The capability to operate on LWRs waste constitutes one of the major benefits of the Gas Turbine-Modular Helium Reactor; in this paper, it has been evaluated the possibility to incinerate the LWRs waste and to simultaneously breed fissile U-233 by fertile thorium. Since a mixture of pure Pu-239-thorium has shown a quite poor neutron economy, the LWRs waste-thorium fuel performance has been also tested when plutonium and thorium are allocated in different TRISO particles. More precisely, when fissile and fertile actinides share the same TRISO kernel, the resonance at 0.29 eV of the fission and capture microscopic cross sections of Pu-239 diminishes also the absorption rate of fertile Th-232 and thus it degrades the breeding process. Consequently, in the present studies, two different types of fuel have been utilized: the Driver Fuel, made of LWRs waste, and the Transmutation Fuel, made of fertile thorium. Since, in the thermal neutron energy range, the microscopic capture cross section of Th-232 is about 80-100 times smaller than the fission one of Pu-239, setting thorium in particles with a large kernel and LWRs waste in particles with a small one makes the volume integrated reaction rates better equilibrated. At the light of the above consideration, which drives to load as much thorium as possible, for the Transmutation Fuel they have been selected the JAERI TRISO particles packed 40%; whereas, for the Driver Fuel they have been tested different packing fractions and kernel radii. Since no configuration allowed the reactor to work, the above procedure has been repeated when fertile particles are packed 20%; the latter choice permits over one year of operation, but the build op of U-233 represents only a small fraction of the depleted Pu-239. Finally, the previous configuration has been also investigated when the fertile and fissile fuels share the same kernel or when the fertile fuel axially alternates with the fissile one.

The calculated criticality condition data were the estimated critical and the estimated lower-limit critical masses and volumes of spheres, diameters of infinitely-long cylinders and thicknesses of infinite-area slabs of uranium materials in six chemical forms encountered in criticality safety evaluation of nuclear fuel cycle facilities. The chemical forms were U-H2O, UO2-H2O, UO2F2, UO2(NO3)(2), ADU-H2O and UF6-HF, the first and last ones of which were not dealt with the Data Collection. The calculations were made with the continuous-energy Monte Carlo criticality calculation code MVP and the Japanese Evaluated Nuclear Data Library JENDL-3.2. The values and precision of the present calculations are discussed in comparison with previous results.

This beam line has a high mass resolution magnet and a high energy resolution electrostatic analyzer to remove the interfering peaks. Reproducibility of 0.53% and precision of 1.1% attained after solving some problems and realigning the equipments again are better than those of the acceptance test. It was demonstrated that this beam title has excellent measurement linearity between 10(-10) and 10(-12) iodine isotopic ratio by testing standard samples which have a variety of iodine isotopic ratios. Its detection limit is substantially below 10(-13) iodine isotopic ratio. Evaluating these performance tests, it was found that this iodine line would be a potentially powerful tool not only for monitoring around a nuclear facility but also for geochemical Studies such as dating and tracing in hydrogeologic and oceanographic research.

Sorption studies of europium(III) on hydrous silica	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							AQUEOUS ORTHOSILICIC ACID; ION EXCHANGE PROPERTIES; NATURAL SYSTEMS; COMPLEXATION; RADIONUCLIDES; URANYL(VI); SI(OH)(4); PLUTONIUM; DIOXIDE; URANIUM	Sorption behavior of europium, Eu3+, on SiO(2)(.)xH(2)O (silica gel) has been investigated as a function of time, the amount of silica gel, Eu3+ concentration, the ionic strength, and pH (in absence and in presence of carbonate). The sorption data were fitted to Freundlich, Langmuir and Dubinin-Radushkevich (D-R) isotherms. The sorption capacity of silica gel was determined to be in the range of (2.62-8.00)(.)10(-7) mol/g at pH 5.30 +/- 0.05 and 0.20M NaClO4. The mean energy of sorption was calculated to be 13.50 +/- 0.05 kJ/mol from the D-R isotherm, suggesting the involvement of ion-exchange reactions in the sorption process. Sorption of Eu3+ decreased with increased ionic strength. A gradual decrease in pH with increased ionic strength supports the involvement of an ion-exchange mechanism in the sorption process.

Environmental monitoring as an important tool for safeguards of nuclear material and nuclear forensics	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							INDUCTIVELY-COUPLED PLASMA; MASS SPECTROMETER; RATIO MEASUREMENT; ISOTOPIC ANALYSES; LEAD; POLLUTION; ELEMENTS; CADMIUM; COPPER	The use of environmental monitoring as a technique to identify activities related to the nuclear fuel cycle has been proposed by international safeguards organizations. The elements specific for each kind of nuclear activity, or "nuclear signatures", inserted in the ecosystem can be intercepted by different live organisms. This work demonstrates the technical viability of using pine needles as bioindicators of nuclear signatures associated with uranium enrichment activities. Additionally, it proposes the use of HR-ICP-MS to identify the signature corresponding to that kind of activities in the ecosystem. Nitric acid solutions, used to wash pine needles sampled near nuclear facilities and containing only 0.1 mg(.)kg(-1) of uranium, exhibit a n((235)U)/n((238)U) isotopic abundance ratio of 0.0092 +/- 0.0002, while solutions originated from samples collected at places located more than 200 km far from activities related to the nuclear fuel cycle exhibit a value of 0.0074 +/- 0.0002. Similar results were obtained for sample solutions prepared using the acid leaching process. The different values of n((235)U)/n((238)U) isotopic abundance ratio obtained permit to confirm the presence of anthropogenic uranium and demonstrate the viability of using the methodology proposed in this work.

Kinetic and thermodynamic studies of cesium(I) sorption on hydrous silica	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							IONIC-STRENGTH; HANFORD SITE; SUBSURFACE SEDIMENTS; TITANIUM-DIOXIDE; URANYL IONS; ILLITE; ACID; MONTMORILLONITE; ADSORPTION; MINERALS	Batch sorption experiments of cesium, Cs+, on SiO(2)(.)xH(2)O (silica gel) have been conducted with variable times of equilibration, amounts of silica gel (0.10-1.00 g), cesium concentrations (5.00(.)10(-5)-2.40(.)10(-3)M), ionic strengths (0.20-1.40M NaClO4), pH (2.50-7.70), and temperatures (273-333 K). The diffusion coefficient of Cs+ ion was calculated to be (9.19 +/- 0.86)(.) 10(-11) m(2.) s(-1) under particle diffusion-controlled conditions. The sorption rate was (3.94 +/- 0.65)(.)10(-3) s(-1) at 298 K, pH 7.70 +/- 0.05 in 0.20M NaClO4. The sorption data fits the Freundlich, Langmuir and Dubinin-Radushkevich (D-R) isotherms. Cesium sorption on 0.20 g silica gel decreased with ionic strength from (40.42 +/- 0.34)% in 0.20M NaClO4 to (6.35 +/- 0.40)% in 1.40M NaClO4, at pH((initial)) 8.20 +/- 0.05. A gradual decrease in pH with increased ionic strength is consistent with a cation-exchange mechanism. Sorption of Cs+ on silica gel decreased with increased temperature, indicating an exothermic enthalpy. The presence of anions such as fluoride, carbonate, phosphate and oxalate in the aqueous medium did not influence the cesium sorption profile.

Effects of the presence of pyrite and carbonate minerals on the kinetics of the uranium release from a natural rock	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							PERMEABLE REACTIVE BARRIERS; CONTAMINATED SEDIMENTS; LEAD IMMOBILIZATION; PH; HYDROXYAPATITE; OXIDATION; DISSOLUTION; SOLUBILITY; ADSORPTION; METALS	The influence of calcite, dolomite, pyrite and vaterite on the kinetics of uranium release from a natural rock under relevant, i.e., field conditions has been investigated. The time dependence of the U release has been studied in two different experimental procedures (open and closed systems) at laboratory temperature (21 +/- 2 degrees C). Performing batch experiments in tap water, the U release efficiency of a natural U-bearing rock was characterized in the presence of varying amounts of three different carbonate bearing minerals for experimental durations of up to 782 days. Another experiment was conducted for a period of 14 days in the presence of a pyrite mineral. The results demonstrate that the presence of carbonate minerals does not have any significant influence on U release in closed systems where the U concentration at saturation was ca. 54 mg/l. In contrast, in open systems, the U concentration was ca. 8 mg/l at saturation and the effects of all additives both on kinetics and saturation concentration of U were apparent.

Recovery of plutonium from oxalate supernatant using 1-phenyl-3-methyl-4-benzoyl-5-pyrazolone	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							EXTRACTION; BASICITY	Extraction of Pu(IV) from oxalate supernatant was carried out employing 1-phenyl-3-methyl-4-benzoyl-5-pyrazolone (PMBP) in xylene as extractant. The conditions for quantitative extraction were determined by the variation of ligand, oxalic acid and nitric acid concentration. Quantitative stripping was achieved using a mixture of 0.4M oxalic acid and 0.4M ammonium oxalate. Extraction of Pu(IV) from synthetic oxalate supernatant solution containing 3M nitric acid and 0.2M oxalic acid was investigated under various loading conditions employing 1-phenyl-3-methyl-4-benzoyl-5-pyrazolone in xylene as extractant. Under uranium loading conditions the Pu extraction decreased significantly while with increased Pu loading whereas the D-Pu value was influenced marginally. The effect of a redox reagent on Pu extraction was also investigated.

Neptunium, plutonium and Cs-137 sorption by bentonite clays and their speciation in pore waters	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							MONTMORILLONITE; COMPLEXES; SMECTITE	The properties of bentonite to remove radionuclides from aqueous solutions were studied as a function of pH and ionic strength. The sorption of cesium is due to ion-exchange while in the case of actinides, sorption is defined by surface complexation at neutral and slightly alkaline conditions and by both mechanisms at acidic pH. Due to the presence of Fe(II), actinides are reduced to low valence states that defines their strong retention onto bentonite and low solubilities. The solubility of both neptunium and plutonium were in the order of 2(.)10(-8)-4.10(-8)M with amorphous An(IV)O-2 as solubility limiting phases.

The conventional log-log analysis of the extraction data reveals that the stoichiometry of the extracted species is 1 : 1 metal ion to ligand ratio for the two metals. The effects of ligand concentration, types of diluent and concentration of the salting-out agents are investigated and discussed.

The breakthrough curve of Sr through a quartz sand column in the presence of HA was identical to that in the absence of HA. Europium migration in quartz sand was enhanced by the presence of HA at low ionic strength. At high ionic strength, Eu migration in the presence of HA was hindered compared to that in the absence of HA. Adsorption of europium on quartz sand in the absence of HA decreases with increased ionic strength.

Separation of europium, cobalt and zinc on zirconium tungstate ion exchanger	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							HYDROUS MANGANESE OXIDE; RADIOTRACER; ADSORPTION; STRONTIUM; MOLYBDATE; REMOVAL; ACID	Amorphous zirconium tungstate inorganic ion-exchanger has been prepared under optimum conditions and characterized by IR, X-ray and thermal analysis. Surface area and capacity are determined. It has characteristic IR absorption peaks at 3242, 1628, 955, 868 and 432 cm(-1) and is thermally stable up to 450 degrees C. Its surface area was 16 m(2)/g with an exchange capacity of 0.541 meq/g. The sorption of radioactive europium from different media at ambient temperature by the zirconium tungstate (ZW) exchanger has been studied. The aim was to optimize the conditions for sorbing Eu from radioactive waste and cleaned the ZW from for recycling. The effect of contact time, metal concentration, pH and temperature has been measured. Percentual uptake of Eu(III) reaches 95% for HCl at pH 4 and increases with temperature indicating an endothermic sorption process. Uptake of Zn(II) and Co(II) on ZW from acetic acid was found to be 42% and 24% for cobalt and zinc, respectively. Desorption after saturation and the effect of other radioactive ions on the percentual uptake of Eu on ZW were investigated. A solution of 3M HCl releases 90%, 25% and 13% of the loaded Eu(III), Co(II) and Zn(II), respectively.

Melt densification of radioactive plastic wastes	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article								Volume reduction studies were carried out on low level radioactive plastic wastes containing polyethylene, PVC and neoprene by melt densification. The optimized temperature for melting of plastics was between 170 and 180 degrees C. Based on laboratory scale studies. Plant scale studies were planned and conducted. The volume reduction factors obtained were around 30, which was 6-10 times higher than that of the conventional compaction process. Thermogravimetry and infrared spectroscopy were used to investigate the thermal and structural properties of the given materials. The effect of the presence of salts like potassium permanganate and hydrazine sulphate on the thermal properties of the materials was also evaluated. Leaching studies were also performed on melt-densified specimens in the laboratory. The average leach index was observed to be around 9, which was higher than the minimum stipulated value.

Solvent extraction, speciation, separation and recovery of uranium(VI) from nuclear fuel, phosphate rocks and monazite sand with N-phenylbenzo-18-crown-6-hydroxamic acid	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							LIGAND STABILITY-CONSTANTS; PLASMA-MASS SPECTROMETRY; HYDROXAMIC ACIDS; METAL-IONS; THORIUM(IV); ATOMIZATION	A method for solvent extraction, separation and recovery of uranium was developed using a new reagent, N-phenylbenzo-18-crown-6-hydroxamic (PBCHA) in the presence of cerium, thorium and lanthanides. Uranium was extracted with a dichloromethane solution of PBCHA producing an orange coloured complex at l(max) = 400 nm with a molar absorptivity of 5.0(.)10(4) l(.)mol(-1) (.) cm(-1) and which obeyed Beer's Law in the range of 0.48-5.76 ppm. For ICP-AES the extract was directly introduced into the plasma to enhance the sensitivity several folds with a detection limit of 0.5 ppb. The extraction constants of uranium crown hydroxamic acid complexes were also determined. The selectivity factors K-uranyl(b(2)K/K or b(2)K'(e)/K) for uranium crown hydroxamate were evaluated by comparing the K-uranyl with the stability constants of competing metal cations (K) and anions (K) and were found remarkably large. Uranium was recovered in 99.95% purity from monazite sand and phosphate rocks. It could be also preconcentrated and determined in environmental samples.

The Empire II model was used to calculate the excitation functions for the different products from bombardment of Th by protons. The calculated thick target yield for Pa-230 is 0.6 mCi/mA(.) h, leading to about 24 mCi/mA(.)h of U-230 or about 150 mCi/mA(.)h in the case of alpha-bombardment.

Ageing of metallic gaskets for spent fuel casks: Century-long life forecast from 25,000-h-long experiments	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article								An experimental programme is being carried out that aims at quantifying the relaxation of four types of metallic HELICOFLEX (R) seals during their use in spent nuclear fuel storage casks. Two types of lining are taken into account: aluminium and silver. Tests longer than 10,000h are implemented only for silver. For each type of lining, two different section diameters are investigated. The work aims at evaluating the minimum residual linear load that can be guaranteed for a seal after a particular time of relaxation. This relaxation depends on the evolution of the seal temperature with time. Therefore, holds of seals tightened between two flanges have been performed at several constant temperatures, including 100 and 200 degrees C. Residual load and 'useful' recovery have been measured after the holds. Results are interpreted according to two methods: a time extrapolation. and a time-temperature equivalence parameter. Both methods are based on linear relationships and are assessed through a statistical analysis (calculation of scatter) which is also used to determine a minimum guaranteed residual load. Finite element simulations of the relaxation of a seal have also been performed in order to justify qualitatively that the time extrapolation method is safe. For silver lining seals, the use of a time-temperature equivalence parameter equal to T (11 + log(10) (t)) appears justified and this enables us to assess the maximum temperature at which seals can be 'safely' used 'up to a century'. Using the available ageing results (longest holds: 25,000 h), and the proposed prediction method, it can be proven that the two types of silver lining seals which are evaluated will retain a residual linear load of at least 100 N mm(-1) of seal perimeter after one century of use in a cask, if the initial temperature of the seal after closing the cask is less than or equal to 100 degrees C.

The material was synthesized at the University of Rome "Tor Vergata" where both heteroepitaxial polycrystalline diamond films and homoepitaxial single-crystal diamonds are grown using a tubular MWCVD reactor. The quality of chemical vapour deposited diamond was characterized by cathodoluminescence, photoluminescence, Raman spectroscopy and thermally stimulated currents. Then, suitable samples were selected and used to fabricate photoconductive single-pixel and 2D array devices by evaporating metal contacts on the growth surface. The electro-optical characterization of the devices was carried out in a wide spectral region, ranging from 120 to 2400 nm. A deuterium lamp and a 0.5 m vacuum monochromator were used to measure the detector responsivity under continuous monochromatic irradiation in the 120-250 nm spectral range, while an optical parametric oscillator tunable laser producing 5 ns pulses was used as light source from 2 10 up to 2400 nm. Time response, signal-to-noise ratio, responsivity and visible rejection factor were evaluated and the results are hereafter summarized. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Comparison of Cadmium-Zinc-Telluride semiconductor and Yttriuim-Aluminum-Perovskite scintillator as photon detectors for epithermal neutron spectroscopy	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	4th International Conference on New Developments in Photodetection	JUN 19-24, 2005	Beaune, FRANCE	DSM CEA, IN2P3 CNRS, Univ Savoie		CZT; YAP; epithermal neutron; neutron spectroscopy; resonance detector	ELECTRON-VOLT SPECTROSCOPY; RESONANT DETECTOR; SCATTERING; SPECTROMETER; VESUVIO	The range of applications of epithermal neutron scattering experiments has been recently extended by the development of the Resonance Detector. In a Resonance Detector, resonant neutron absorption in an analyzer foil results in prompt emission of X- and 7rays which are detected by a photon counter. Several combinations of analyzer foils and photon detectors have been studied and tested over the years and best results have been obtained with the combination of a natural uranium and (i) Cadmium-Zinc-Tellu ride (CZT) semiconductor, (ii) Yttrium-Aluminum-Perovskite (YAP) scintillators. Here we compare the performance of the CZT semiconductor and YAP scintillator as Resonance Detector units. Two Resonance Detector prototypes made of natural uranium foil viewed by CZT and YAP were tested on the VESUVIO spectrometer at the ISIS spallation. neutron source. The results show that both YAP and CZT can be used to detect epithermal neutrons in the energy range from 1 up to 66eV. It was found that the signal-to- background ratio of the measurement can significantly be improved by raising the lower level discrimination threshold on the gamma energy to about 600keV. The advantages/disadvantages of the choice of a Resonance Detector based on YAP or CZT are discussed together with some potential applications. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

These measurements were made using a new apparatus with an HpGe detector. These new measurements allow one to determine the mass absorption coefficients for dozens of materials. As expected their values were Z-dependent. Additionally for Z > 32 some oscillatory dependence was observed. Using these measurements we propose an improvement to the well known results of Gleasen et al. [G.I. Gleason, I.D. Taylor, D.L. Tabern, Nucleonics 8 (1951) 12] for the formula giving the value of the mass absorption coefficient. We carried out Monte Carlo simulations for the implantation profile, which indicated that only in some intermediate region does one expect the standard exponential behavior. In the near and far regions the simulations indicate behavior different from the intermediate region. Based on the experimental studies and the Monte Carlo simulations a new formula for the implantation profile is proposed. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The guide is designed to evacuate daughter recoils originating from the alpha-decay of a U-233 source. The source is electroplated onto stainless steel strips and mounted along the inner walls of an ion guide chamber. A combination of electric fields and helium gas flow transport the ions through an exit hole for injection into a mass separator.

Homogenization method for the two-dimensional low-order quasi-diffusion equations for reactor core calculations	NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article							APPROXIMATION	In this paper, we develop a homogenization methodology for the two-dimensional low-order quasi-diffusion equationsforfull-core reactor calculations that is based on a family of spatially consistent coarse-mesh discretization methods. The coarse-mesh solution generated by these methods preserves a number of spatial moments of the fine-mesh transport solution over each assembly. The proposed method reproduces accurately the complicated large-scale behavior of the transport solution within assemblies. To demonstrate the performance of the developed methodology, we present the numerical results of several test problems that simulate mixed-oxide-uranium and assembly-reflector interfacial effects.

J	Takahashi, M				Takahashi, Masato			Off-gas source estimation for boiling water reactors under various operation conditions	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						off gas source; boiling water reactor; fission gas		Radioactive fission gases (krypton and xenon) are observed in boiling water reactor (BWR) plants without defective fuel under various operation conditions. The off-gas in a BWR plant without defective fuel arises from fissile impurities within the cladding materials and/or fissile material deposited on the cladding surface. To estimate the off-gas source in operating plants, the source estimation method considering the off-gas transport time from production to measurement was applied to the data collected under various plant operation conditions. This' method was verified by the adaptation of three sets of off-gas data groups to the source of cladding impurity and/or deposition actually observed in the plants. The judgment as to whether off-gas derives from a cladding impurity or a deposition was made by analyzing the data of 11 BWRs with different off-gas levels.

For this purpose, a spatial kinetics calculation module is developed and implemented in SCAN, a three-dimensional (3-D) CANDU pressurized heavy water reactor neutronics design and analysis code. Then, a dynamic linked library of the SCAN code is generated for the integration with RELAP-CANDU. The RELAP-CANDU code has been developed, for best-estimate transient simulation of CANDU reactor coolant systems based on the RELAP5 code. The SCAN code is a 3-D neutronic calculation code, which is composed of both unified nodal methods based on coarse-mesh finite difference method solutions to the time-dependent two-group diffusion equations. To verify the reliability of the coupled code system RELAP-CANDU/SCAN, the 40% reactor inlet header break accident, the 100% reactor outlet header break accident,. and the pump suction pipe break are analyzed. The proposed coupled thermal-hydraulic and neutronic analyses methodology shows that there is an important margin in the traditional accident analysis.

The objective of the optimization was to minimize the residual binding due to residual Gd isotopes in the fuel at the end of cycle (EOC). The GA process for creating new BP designs in a coded form called genotypes is generated randomly resulting in a large number of invalid designs. Each new BP design or genotype created by the new GA must be decoded into its corresponding phenotype so that it can be evaluated with a coupled fuel lattice and core depletion calculation. It is essential that most of the invalid designs be eliminated before performing the precise coupled fuel lattice calculation because of the long CPU time that it takes for this calculation. The elimination was accomplished in the new GA by incorporating a beginning-of-cycle (BOC) K-inf filter. The BOC K-inf filter eliminated most of the invalid new genotypes by assigning a high negative penalty to all genotypes that have a BOC K-inf greater than some limit (1.065) for the reference TMI-1 FA. This filter eliminates the need for performing coupled lattice and core depletion calculations for these genotypes. It accelerated the solution process and allowed evaluation of, all new genotypes within one day. In this way, the GA minimized the residual binding using an objective function, which maximized the EOC soluble boron (SB) concentration. In essence, the EOC SB or its equivalent EOC k(eff) was maximized.

Of importance was the previous development of a K-inf filter, which greatly reduced the computational time. The Kinf filter eliminated many of the invalid genotypes/phenotypes before making a precise core depletion analysis. An extensive BP library was generated by the CASMO-4/TABLES-3 codes. The process was automated with a user-friendly program developed for this purpose. The BPs were vendor UO2/Gd2O3 fuel assembly designs used in a reference Three Mile Island Unit 1 core. The optimized UO2/Gd2O3 fuel pin configurations have small residual binding at end of cycle (EOC), and BP loading optimization results with 97.2 ppm soluble boron at EOC while it was 94.4 ppm with the available vendor designs. The result was that optimized UO2/Gd2O3 fuel pin configurations were developed with unique self-shielding properties and residual binding that also provided a 6.89% reduction in the total required Gd amount, providing extra savings in fuel cost.

J	Lim, DH				Lim, Doo-Hyun			Numerical study of nuclide migration in a nonuniform horizontal flow field of a high-level radioactive waste repository with multiple canisters	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						geological radio-active waste disposal; repository performance assessment; flow and transport		Migration of nuclides in a water-saturated high-level radioactive waste repository is analyzed by a newly developed two-dimensional numerical model incorporating a multiple-canister configuration and a nonuniform horizontal flow field of the host rock. The nonuniform flow field is established numerically by obtaining space-dependent groundwater flow velocity vectors using the finite element method. Transport of nuclides is simulated for the instantaneous-pulse-input source condition using the random-walk method. The current study for advection-dominant host rock shows quantitatively that the migration of nuclides in a repository adopting the disposal-pit vertical-emplacement concept is influenced not only by the canister configuration but also by flow boundary conditions, where groundwater flow is considered to be horizontal to the repository plane. The effects of applied hydraulic gradient direction theta(h) on nuclide migration become more significant as the number of canisters increases; while the effects are negligible for the single-canister configuration. As the number of canisters increases, the results of nuclide migration with respect to. eh range more widely and are bounded by two extreme cases. The theta(h) orthogonal to the orientation of the disposal tunnel is observed as most advantageous in terms of the isolation of the radionuclide. The single-canister configuration yields conservative results compared with the multiple-canister configuration.

Behavior of L beta(2) visible satellites in gold around L-1 threshold	RADIATION PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	20th International Conference on X-Ray and Inner-Shell Processes	JUL 04-08, 2005	Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, AUSTRALIA		Univ Melbourne	Coster-Kronig transition; visible satellite	L-SERIES LINES; EMISSION-SPECTRA; IRIDIUM; URANIUM; WIDTHS; L-ALPHA-1	The Au L beta(2) visible satellites, L beta(')(2) and L beta(")(2) were measured around the L-1 absorption edge using a high-resolution Johann-type spectrometer at BLI5XU, SPring-8. The relative intensities of the L beta(')(2) and L beta(")(2) satellites to that of the L beta(2) line exhibit an abrupt jump at the L-1 threshold. The results suggest that the origin of the L beta(2) satellites is mainly the L-1-L3M4,5 Coster-Kronig transitions. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The experimental advances in this field will be reviewed with special emphasis given to H-, He- and Li-like very heavy ions. For the heaviest species, U, the ground-state Lamb shift for H-like ions is measured with an accuracy of about 1%, the two-electron QED terms for He-like system are just being touched, and for the Li-like species already two-loop QED terms have been probed with ultimate accuracy. The different approaches to measure the strong field QED contributions will be elucidated and the results compared to theory. Emphasis will be given to results from the heavy ion storage ring ESR.
