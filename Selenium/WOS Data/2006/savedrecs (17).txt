Alpha-activities due to annual U-238 and Th-232 intakes from the ingestion of the studied foodstuffs were determined in different compartments of the human body of adult members of the public by using the ICRP biokinetic models for these radionuclides. Committed equivalent doses due to annual intakes of U-238 and Th-232 were evaluated in the human body compartments of adult members of the Moroccan population. Data obtained were compared with those obtained by using the ICRP ingestion dose coefficients. The influence of the mass of the target tissue and activities due to U-238 and Th-232 on the committed equivalent doses due to annual intakes of these radionuclides in the compartments of the human body was investigated.

Principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) have been applied to air kerma values measured by thermoluminescent dosimetry in several sites and to data of radionuclide concentrations, geochemical and mineralogical features of rocks and soils sampled in 29 sites of Sicily to point out similarities among different lithologies. The study was devoted to find multiple correlations and allow a better classification of Sicilian lithotypes. Samples of rocks and soils have been analyzed by X-ray fluorescence (XRF), X-ray diffractometry (XRD), and gamma-ray spectrometry. Major element concentrations, mineralogical data, along with specific activities of K-40, U-238, and Th-232 natural radionuclides, have been determined in several samples. Geochemical, mineralogical and petrographic features are in good agreement with radiometric data. A survey was also performed to measure air kerma in outdoor environment using thermoluminescent dosimeters. The measured values were compared with the predicted levels computed from the radioisotope concentrations present in rock and soil samples. Moreover, collected data can be used to evaluate the health impact of the natural radioactivity on the population. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this context, ore samples were placed in plastic containers with CR-39-based NRPB radon dosimeters installed in them. The containers were then hermetically scaled and the dosimeters were exposed to radon for three weeks to equilibrate Rn-222 and Ra-226. After exposure, CR-39 detectors were etched in 25% NaOH at 80 degrees C for 16 h and counted under an optical microscope. The track densities thus obtained were related to radon concentrations using calibration factor of 2.7Tracks cm(-2) h(-1)(kBq m(-3)). From the measured radon concentration values, Ra-226 activities were calculated that ranged from 157 to 454 Bq kg(-1). Using these activity values, assuming secular equilibrium, U-238 contents were calculated which ranged from 13 to 37 ppm, in the ore samples under study. In order to verify the validity of the assumption of secular equilibrium, the above samples were analyzed with a high-resolution inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES). The results obtained from this method showed higher 238U content that ranged from 356 to 2061 ppm which was a clear indication that there is disequilibrium between Ra-226 and U-238. Due to the unavailability of the 226Ra standard for ICP-AES, the equilibrium factor was therefore determined using HPGe-based gamma spectrometry technique. Here. specific activity of 226Ra was determined using gamma line at 609.3keV (46.1%) of Bi-214. Then specific activity of U-238 was determined using the gamma line at 143.76keV (10.5%) of U-235. Calibration factor, defined as the ratio of the specific activities of Ra-226 and U-238, was determined. The NRPB dosimeter data were then corrected for the equilibrium factor which resulted in U-238 contents that ranged from 229 to 1968 ppm. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All tights reserved.

Of the study participants, 1092 were employed at four Department of Energy sites where plutonium-bearing materials were processed or stored. Exposures were assessed by first categorising exposure potentials based on available bioassay data, then estimating doses for workers in the highest categories using recent recommendations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection. Given the aetiology of leukaemia, equivalent dose to active bone marrow was chosen as the exposure variable. There were 556 workers each with at least one plutonium bioassay result, assigned to one of three evaluation categories. Dose estimates were made for 115 workers resulting in a collective equivalent dose of 2.1 person-Sv for 2822 exposure-years, compared with 29.8 person-Sv estimated from photon exposures. Modelling uncertainties were examined by comparison of results from independent analyses and by Monte Carlo simulation.

A formulation based on both a streamlined flow model and a well-mixed flow model in the chamber has been made to estimate thoron concentration in breath from the observed alpha counts. The experimental measurements of the ratio of the outlet and the inlet thoron concentrations across the chamber strongly validate the well-mixed flow model for thoron, as against the streamlined flow model. The progeny collection efficiency on the electrode has been found to be 70%. The study points out a major error by a factor of similar to 25 in the calibration factor reported in an earlier work. From the present study, the minimum detectable limit of the activity of Ra-224, freely emanating thoron at mouth works out to be 0.36 Bq as against 0.014 Bq reported earlier for the same system.

This slag has been used as filling and/or insulating material in building works. The aim of this study was to investigate the radiological situation in this territory in terms of the possible impact of this residual material from coal. Flats in three towns with a coal mine and a coal-fired power plant operating in their neighbourhood were examined. The radionuclide contents (including Ra-226, Th-232 and K-40) of the slag used for building were determined, and the slags were categorised according to the international standards and recommendations. The external gamma dose rate and the radon concentration in the sites were measured, and based on these data dose assessments were made. The Ra-226 concentration of the slag was 160-2893 Bq kg(-1); the indoor gamma dose rates were 82-633 nGy h(-1); the radon concentration measured with a nuclear track detector varied from 29 to 1310 Bq m(-3); the assessed dose contributions in the three towns were 0.65-1.57 mSv y(-1) due to gamma radiation and 2.2-15.2 mSv y(-1) due to radon.

The activity concentrations of radionuclides Pb-214, Bi-214, K-40, Ra-226 and Cs-137 were determined using high resolution gamma ray spectrometry. Furthermore, Rn-222 activity concentrations in tap water samples were measured using Liquid Scintillation Counting. The mean specific activities of Pb-214, Bi-214, Ra-226, K-40, Cs-137 and Rn-222 in tap water samples were 6.73, 6, 19.16, 168.57, 5.45 mBq l(-1) and 10.82 Bq l(-1), respectively. These values are comparable with concentrations reported for other countries. The effective doses were determined due to intake of these radionuclides as a consequence of direct consumption of tap water samples. The estimated effective doses were 6.878 x 10(-4) mu Sv y(-1) for Pb-214, 4.800 x 10(-4) mu Sv y(-1) for Bi-214, 3.916 mu Sv y(-1) for Ra-226, 0.763 mu Sv y(-1) for K-40, 0.052 mu Sv y(-1) for Cs-137 and 5.848 mu Sv y(-1) for Rn-222.

The average activity concentrations observed in different building materials ranged from 27.7 +/- 7.5 to 70.4 +/- 2.8, 5.9 +/- 0.67 to 32.9 +/- 3.9 and 30.8 +/- 0.87 to 58.5 +/- 1.5 for Ra-226, Th-232 and K-40, respectively. The activity concentrations of Ra-226 measured in fine aggregates was found to be among the highest values obtained in this work. The ranges of the calculated Ra-equivalent were found to be lower than those values recommended for construction materials (370 Bq kg(-1)). The average internal and external hazard indices were found to be < 1. The average of the calculated annual gonadal equivalent dose was found to be 198 mu Sv y(-1). Results indicate no significant radiological hazards arise from using such materials in building construction.

A correlation of 0.99 was found between the two ICPMS methods and of 0.98 with alpha-spectrometry. The range of activity ratios was between 0.9 and 2.6 according to the MC-ICPMS measurements. The reproducibility of both ICPMS techniques was better than 4% for water samples containing 1 mu g l(-1) of uranium and a U-234/U-238 atom ratio of 54.9 x 10(-6). Sample preparation for the ICPMS consisted of dilution of water samples containing > 10 mu g l(-1) of uranium and measurement time was similar to 1 min, while alpha-spectrometry involved pre-concentration and separation of the uranium and counting times of 1000 min.

Continuous measurements of radon using pulse ionisation chambers and scintillation cell techniques were employed for these studies. Progenies of radon were collected on filter paper, and then a three-count procedure was used for the measurement. The equilibrium state between radon and its decay products has been determined. Concentrations of natural radionuclides (Ra-226, Th-232 and K-40) in ore and soil samples taken from various locations in each mine have been measured using a Canberra High Purity Germanium detector. Based on these measurements two ranges of dose were evident. Doses ranged from 0.1 to 1.52 mSv y(-1) for nine mines and from 10 to 31 mSv y(-1) for the other three mines. A separate grouping of the mines was recognised from radon concentrations, which varied from 2 Bq m(-3) to 10 kBq m(-3). In three of these mines, working level (WL) concentrations of the order of 36-1771 mWL were determined in different working areas. In all other mines, the concentrations were observed to be < 45 mWL.

J	Ziebik, A; Stanek, W				Ziebik, A; Stanek, W			Influence of blast-furnace process thermal parameters on energy and exergy characteristics and exergy losses	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH			English	Article						blast-furnace plant; Cowper stoves; input-output mathematical model; energy and exergy characteristics; exergy losses		The technology 'blast furnace-converter' dominates at present in the production of steel all over the world. Therefore, the blast-furnace process is continuously being improved, among others, by raising the thermal parameters, such as temperature and oxygen-enrichment of the blast, as well as the addition of auxiliary fuels. The changes in the consumption of coke go together with changes in the consumption of blast, the production of top-gas and its consumption in Cowper stoves, as well as the production of electricity in the recovery turbogenerator utilizing the waste exergy of the top-gas due to raised pressure. Related to a unit of pig iron production, these values are called energy (exergy) characteristics of the blast-furnace plant. They serve as a quantity measure of the thermal improvement of the blast-furnace process. This paper presents an algorithm of the process exergy analysis of simulative investigations of the influence of increased thermal parameters on the thermodynamic perfection of the process and the blast-furnace plant. This algorithm bases on the theoretical empirical balance method of the 'input-output' type. By means of this algorithm the influence of increased thermal parameters of the process not only on the saving of coke but also of the blast can be determined, as well as of the production and composition of top-gas, the consumption of top-gas in the Cowper stoves and the production of electric energy in the recovery turbine. The blast-furnace process displays a high exergy efficiency, whereas the process of compressing and preheating the blast is characterized by rather high exergy losses due to the application of the combustion process. It has been shown that the internal exergy losses in the blast furnace are comparable with the exergy losses in the processes of compressing and preheating of the blast. Calculations were carried out for a modern Polish blast furnace with a volume of 3200 m(3). Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

J	Likhanskii, VV; Zborovskii, VG				Likhanskii, VV; Zborovskii, VG			On stability of spatial distributions of crystal structure defects in irradiated high burnup UO2 fuel	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							BEHAVIOR	Conditions of Kinoshita instability development of point defects and dislocation spatial distributions in the crystal structure of UO2 fuel are studied. As a result of the instability development, spatially non-uniform regions with increased dislocation density are formed. Closed-form expressions of instability increment and spatial scale are derived. Parameters of the instability for irradiation conditions of high burnup UO2 fuel are obtained by means of numerical simulation. Instability development time is shown to be inversely proportional to fission rate and it increases as dislocation density decreases. Calculated values of instability spatial scale and increment are in accordance with the size of fine grains and their formation rate in the peripheral zones of high burnup LWR fuel pellets.

J	Hu, JS; Li, JG; Wang, XM				Hu, JS; Li, JG; Wang, XM			Oxygen glow discharge experiment to remove deposited layers and to release trapped hydrogen isotopes in HT-7 superconducting tokamak	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							C-D-LAYERS; IMPLANTED DEUTERIUM; STAINLESS-STEEL; CARBON-FILMS; TRITIUM; GRAPHITE; TUNGSTEN; LIMITER; TILES; TFTR	An experiment to remove re-deposited layers and to release hydrogen using a glow discharge in oxygen (O-GDC) has been performed in the HT-7 superconducting tokamak. In the absence of magnetic fields, the O-GDC wall conditioning had produced rapid, controlled co-deposit removal. Average removal rates, 5.2 x 10(22) H-atoms/h, 5.65 x 10(21) D-atoms/h and 5.53 x 10(22) C-atoms/h, respectively, were obtained during 145 min O-GDC experiment in the pressure range 0.5-1.5 Pa. The corresponding removal rate of co-deposited films was similar to 1.19 mu m/day (26.5 g/day for carbon) based on an area of 12 m(2). Compared to thermo-oxidation and O-ICR experiment, high pressure O-GDC wall conditioning promoted the oxidation and improved the C and D atoms removal. In the O-GDC experiment, the removal rates of H-atoms and D-atoms as H2O, HDO and D2O were higher than that of H-2 and D-2 by factors of about 20 and 50, respectively. During the 145 min O-GDC experiment, about 14.5% O-atoms were converted into carbon oxides and hydroxides.. and about 5.37 x 10(22) O-atoms were adsorbed on the walls corresponding to a coverage of 4.5 x 10(21) O/m(2) on an wall area of 12 m(2). In a 100 min helium glow discharge (He-GDC) following the O-GDC experiment, 1.53 x 10(22) O-atoms, about 28.5% oxygen retained on the walls, were removed. The removal rate of H-atoms in He-GDC cleaning after O-GDC experiment was lower than that in He-GDC cleaning before O-GDC experiment, which indicates that the O-GDC wall conditioning had effectively reduced hydrogen retention oil the walls.

The thermal conductivity data reported were derived from the thermal diffusivity measured by the laser flash method. The factors determining the fuel thermal conductivity at high burn-up were elucidated by investigating the recovery that occurred during thermal annealing. It was found that the thermal conductivity in the outer region of the fuel was much higher than it would have been if the high burn-up structure were not present. The increase in thermal conductivity is a consequence of the removal of fission products and radiation defects from the fuel lattice during recrystallisation of the fuel grains (an integral part of the formation process of the high burn-up structure). The gas porosity in the high burn-up structure lowers the increase in thermal conductivity caused by recrystallisation. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Fan, X; Parker, DJ; Smith, MD				Fan, X; Parker, DJ; Smith, MD			Enhancing F-18 uptake in a single particle for positron emission particle tracking through modification of solid surface chemistry	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						PEPT; surface chemistry; tracer labelling; F-18	FLOTATION; TOMOGRAPHY; ADSORPTION	The positron emission particle tracking (PEPT) technique has been widely used in science and engineering to obtain detailed information on particulate motion in granular materials and flow fields in multiphase systems. The technique involves tracking a single radioactively labelled particle by detecting the pairs of back-to-back 511 keV gamma-rays arising from annihilation of emitted positrons. It is thus crucially dependent on the availability of suitably labelled tracer particles. With the present equipment, the optimum activity for a PEPT tracer is between 300 and 1000 mu Ci. The positron emitting radionuclide most often used is F-18 in the form of fluoride ions. However, most materials have a very poor capacity to take up fluoride naturally. This paper presents a surface modification technique which was developed to improve the adsorption of tsF on solids and therefore extending the application of PEPT. For example. 200 mu m MCC particles are the subject of many PEPT studies, but these particles only adsorb a few mu Ci F-18 naturally, and cannot be used as tracers for PEPT. After surface modification, they take up about 700 mu Ci F-18, and can be tracked very well using PEPT. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Alpha-decay recoil ions from a Ra-223 source served as energetic probes. The combined ion survival and transport efficiencies for Rn-219 ions saturated below about 90 K, reaching 28.7(17)% in helium, 22.1(13)% in neon, and 17.0(10)% in argon. These values may well reflect the charge exchange and stripping cross-sections during the slowing down of the ions, and thus represent a fundamental upper limit for the efficiency of noble gas ion catcher devices. We suggest the cryogenic noble gas ion catcher as a technically simpler alternative to the ultra-high purity noble gas ion catcher operating at room temperature. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The investigation is based on the neutron multiplication factor calculated using the fresh and spent fuel compositions. Fuels based on a fresh composition with high amount of fissile material and low amounts of Np-237 and Am-241 resemble the fast reactor fuel, with the multiplication factor decreasing when calculated using the spent fuel compositions. However, the multiplication factor increases for targets based on a fresh composition without fissile content and high amounts of Np-237 and Am-241, although it remains below 1 for up to 90 GWd/t burnup.

Problems of development of fast reactors self-fuel-provision without fuel reprocessing. Atomkernenergie, 45, NI; Slessarev, I., et al., 2004. WISE: a new fuel cycle concept based on a mobile fuel reactor. Nuclear Technol., 146 (N3), 230-243] and re-organization of the fuel cycle may allow to build the "actinide waste free,"' nuclear power (NP) and to improve radically its proliferation resistance. These goals can be achieved on the base of an "intrinsic approach" respecting long-lived wastes, safety and non-proliferation aspects simultaneously. It implies elimination of feed fuel enrichment, irradiated fuel reprocessing as well as the need for a long-lived, radiotoxic actinide repository. The key concept is: the application of "mobile" (liquid or gaseous) reactor fuels allowing for a simple mixing of fresh and already irradiated fuel components without "'forced" FP separation. The neutronics of the innovative nuclear reactor concept, -MFR- with mobile fuels is discussed in details. Elimination of fuel enrichment implies "natural fuel"' feed with relatively low neutron balance potential, however, the neutronics has to be capable of supporting critical or near-critical regimes to be economically acceptable. Sufficient capability is achieved by utilizing a favorable, hard neutron spectrum (e.g. fast neutron spectrum of SPX-type), in addition to elongation of the fuel in-core residence time and by use of an appropriate core composition with enhanced fissile breeding. No dedicated actinide transmutation (by targets for example) is required in this system. It is concluded that the mobile fuel reactor neutronics in the case of the once-through fuel cycle is almost acceptable to be used for future NP to be protected intrinsically against long-lived actinide wastes, weapons proliferation menace and heavy accidents.

J	Suyama, K; Mochizuki, H				Suyama, K; Mochizuki, H			Corrections to the Nd-148 method of evaluation of burnup for the PIE samples from Mihama-3 and Genkai-1 reactors	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article							VALIDATION	The value of the burnup is one of the most important parameters of samples taken by post-irradiation examination (PIE). Generally, it is evaluated by the Neodymium-148 method. Precise evaluation of the burnup value requires: (1) an effective fission yield of Nd-148; (2) neutron capture reactions of Nd-147 and Nd-148; (3) a conversion factor from fissions per initial heavy metal to the burnup unit GWd/t. In this study, the burnup values of the PIE data from Mihama-3 and Genkai-1 PWRs, which were taken by the Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute, were re-evaluated using more accurate corrections for each of these three items. The PIE data were then re-analyzed using SWAT and SWAT2 code systems with JENDL-3.3 library. The re-evaluation of the effective fission yield of Nd-148 has an effect of 1.5-2.0% on burnup values. Considering the neutron capture reactions of Nd-147 and Nd-148 removes dependence of C/E values of 148Nd on the burnup value. The conversion factor from FIMA(%) to GWd/t changes according to the burnup value. Its effect on the burnup evaluation is small for samples having burnup of larger than 30 GWd/t. The analyses using the corrected burnup values showed that the calculated 148Nd concentrations and the PIE data is approximately 1%, whereas this was 3-5% in prior analyses. This analysis indicates that the burnup values of samples from Mihama-3 and Genkai-1 PWRs should be corrected by 2-3%. The effect of re-evaluation of the burnup value on the neutron multiplication factor is an approximately 0.6% change in PIE samples having the burnup of larger than 30 GWd/t. Finally, comparison between calculation results using a single pin-cell model and an assembly model is carried out. Because the results agreed with each other within a few percent, we concluded that the single pin-cell model is suitable for the analysis of PIE samples and that the underestimation of plutonium isotopes, which occurred in the previous analyses, does not result from a geometry model.

Various techniques have therefore been assigned for this purpose. A nondestructive approach is to measure the gamma radiation from spent nuclear fuel assemblies. Using this technique, parameters such as burnup and cooling time can be calculated or verified. In this paper, we propose the utilization of gamma rays from Cs-137, Cs-134 and Eu-154 to determine the consistency of operator-declared information. Specifically, we have investigated to what extent irradiation histories can be verified. Computer simulations were used in order to determine limits for detecting small deviations from declared data. In addition, the technique has been experimentally demonstrated on 12 PWR fuel assemblies. A technique for determining burnup and cooling time for fuel assemblies where no operator-declared information is available is also presented. In such a case, the burnup could be determined with 1.6% relative standard deviation and the cooling time with 1.5%. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The CASMO-4/TABLES/SIMULATE-3 package calculated the neutronic performance of the enriched UO2/Gd2O3 fuel pin configurations. These configurations included different fractions of neutron absorbing isotopes Gd-155 and Gd-157, and 100 w/o enriched Gd-155 designs. Fuel cost analysis was performed to evaluate the economical benefits of these optimized enriched gadolinium designs. The break-even point for unit Gd-155 enrichment cost was determined to be around similar to$30/gram-Gd-155 with current unit cost scenario. The projected savings were 3.13% in gross and 2.08% in net compared to total fuel cycle cost of a reference TMI-1 core loading, if all of the 68 feed assemblies would be replaced with the optimized designs.

Core BP optimization problem means developing a BP loading map for a given core loading pattern that minimizes the total Gadolinium (Gd) amount in the core without violating any design constraints. The number of UO2/Gd2O3 pins and Gd2O3 concentrations for each fresh fuel location in the core are the decision variables. The objective function was to minimize the total amount of Gd in the core together with the residual Gd reactivity binding at the End-of-Cycle (EOC). The constraints are to keep the maximum peak pin power during the core depletion and soluble boron (SOB) concentration at the Beginning of Cycle (BOC) both less than their limit values. The innovation of this study was to search all of the possible UO2/ Gd2O3 fuel assembly designs with variable number of UO2/Gd2O3 fuel pins and concentration of Gd2O3 in the overall decision space. The use of different fitness functions guided the solution towards desired (good solutions) region in the solution space, which accelerated the GA solution. The main objective of this study was to develop a practical and efficient GA tool and to apply this tool to designing an optimum BP pattern for a given core loading. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

It was found that under the experimental conditions, Co-60 was significantly adsorbed on MnO2, TiO2 and activated carbon and in smaller quantities on MgO, SnO and calcined hydrotalcite. The adsorption of Co-60 species on MgO, MnO2, TiO2 and SnO can be attributed to the direct exchange of ions with a specific group on the adsorbing surface, in accordance with the concept of zero point charge (zpc). The radionuclide content was determined by gamma-spectrometry. The Co-60 chemical species present in aqueous solutions with different pH values were surveyed by using high-voltage electrophoresis. It was also found that Co-60 was present only as a cationic species at pH 1, 3, 5 and 7 and a neutral species at alkaline pH. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Twenty two nuclear reaction cross sections included in the National Nuclear Data Center's (NNDC) data base were selected from the possible nuclear reactions between 9.6 MeV protons and a silver havar target. Ten radionuclides: Mn-52, Fe-55, Co-55, Co-56, Co-57, Co-58, Ni-59, Tc-95, Tc-96 and Cd-109 were detected experimentally in [O-18]H2O by using high purity germanium semiconductor detectors. The activities of the 10 radionuclides were distributed between 4 Bq and 1.2 kBq. These activities were less than the reference values given in the International Basic Safety Standards. The radionuclides derived from nuclear reactions between a silver target body and 9.6 MeV protons at a beam current 25 mu A for 60 min irradiation would be exempt from restrictions for radioactive waste. The purified [F-18]FDG prepared from 18 F produced by irradiating a silver havlar target with 9.6 MeV protons was not contaminated by the radionuclides. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We have applied microfluidic technology to synthesise PET radiopharmaceuticals using F-18 and 124 1 as labels for fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and Annexin-V, respectively. These reactions involved established methods of nucleophilic substitution on a mannose triflate precursor and direct iodination of the protein using iodogen as an oxidant. This has demonstrated a proof of principle of using microfluidic technology to radiochemical reactions involving low and high molecular weight compounds. Using microfluidic reactions, [F-18]FDG was synthesised with a 50% incorporation of the available F-18 radioactivity in a very short time of 4s. The radiolabelling efficiency of I-124 Annexin-V was 40% after 1 min reaction time. Chromatographic analysis showed that such reaction yields are comparable to conventional methods, but in a much shorter time. The yields can be further improved with more optimisation of the microfluidic device itself and its fluid mixing profiles. This demonstrates the potential for this technology to have an impact on rapid and simpler radiopharmaceutical synthesis using short and medium half-life radionuclides. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Within the styrylamidine subclass, (E)-N-(2-methoxybenzyl)-3-phenylacrylamidine (1), displayed the highest affinity (Ki = 0.7 nM versus [H-3]ifenprodil) and was considered an appropriate candidate for isotopic labelling with carbon-11 (T-1/2: 20.38 min) at its methoxy group for imaging of NMDA receptors with PET. Derivative I has been labelled from the corresponding nor-analogue using [C-11]methyl triflate and the following experimental conditions : (1) trapping at -10 degrees C of [C-11]methyl triflate in 300 mu L of acetone containing 0.6-0.8mg of precursor 5 (2.4-3.2 mu mol) and 5 mu L of a 3M solution of NaOH in water (about 5 eq.); (2) concentration to dryness of the reaction mixture (at 110 degrees C, using a helium stream for 1-2 min); (3) taking up the residue with 0.5 mL of the HPLC mobile phase and (4) purification using semi-preparative HPLC (SymmetryPrep (R) G 18, Waters, 300 x 7.8 mm). Typically, starting from a 1.5 Ci (55.5 GBq) [C-11]CO2 production batch, 120-240 m Ci (4.44-8.88 GBq) of [C-11]-1 (20-40% decay-corrected radiochemical yield, n = 5) was obtained within a total synthesis time of 25-30 min. Specific radioactivities ranged from 0.8 to 1.2 Ci/mu mol (29.6-44.4 GBq/mu mol) at the end of radiosynthesis. No attempts were made to further optimise these reactions, as sufficient material was obtained to allow for preliminary pharmacological characterisation. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Beach sand and soil samples were collected and analyzed for Po-210 and Pb-210 radionuclides using standard radiochemical analytical techniques. Mean activities of Po-210 and Pb-210 were found to be maximum in the samples collected at 20m away from waterline. Among the beach sand samples, the activities of radionuclide were found to be maximum for samples from most of the regions of Chavara and few regions of Neendakara. The activity of Po-210 was found to vary from 2.4 to 20.5 Bq kg(-1) with a mean value of 8.3 Bq kg(-1) at the water line, 2.5-19.9 Bq kg(-1) with a mean value of 10.2 Bq kg(-1) at 20 m away from the waterline, and 2.1-6.7 Bq kg(-1) with a mean value of 3.5 Bq kg(-1) at 40 m away from waterline. The respective values found for Pb-210 were from 1.2 to 48.2 Bq kg(-1) with a mean value of 14.9, 11.3-34.2 Bq kg(-1) with a mean value of 19.8 Bq kg(-1) and 2.3 to 18.3 Bq kg(-1) with a mean value of 8.7 Bq kg(-1). The depth profile study indicated the mean activity of Po-210 to decrease with depth for samples collected 20 in away from waterline whereas the activity slightly increases with depth 40 m away from sea. The activity concentration of Po-210 and Pb-210 in surface beach sand shows good correlation, with a correlation coefficient 0.81. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Electricity and heat supplies cannot be taken for granted. A conclusive long-term energy concept urgently needs to be developed to provide a stable and, above all, reliable framework. The coming Energy Summit is hoped to pave the way for that concept. Germany can gain advantages as a location of industry only by becoming more and more independent of politically unstable regions, i.e., above all by using a broad energy mix. In this respect, which is decisive in ensuring Germany's future, nuclear power must not be left out of consideration. A reassessment of nuclear power can be based on these fundamental statements: - In view of the rising demand for energy worldwide, no energy resource may be left out. - It is wrong to postulate a contrast between renewables and nuclear power. - Nuclear power makes a decisive contribution to the continuity of supply. Worldwide uranium reserves are good not only for 40-60 years but at least for 200 years, and their share in generating costs is minimal. - The CO2 objectives can only be met by using nuclear power, renewable energy resources, achieving higher efficiency, and through saving energy. - There is no reason to doubt the safety of German nuclear power plants. - Opting out of the use of nuclear power would lead to a shortage in electricity generation, at least temporarily. - Solving the waste and spent fuel disposal problem is a political rather than a technical issue. - Nuclear power is a technology for the future.

Methods: A case-control study among former WISMUT miners was conducted to investigate the lung cancer risk in relation to attained age, time since exposure, exposure duration, and exposure rate. It consisted of 505 patients with lung cancer and 1,073 controls matched to cases according to the year of birth. The cumulative exposure to radon and radon decay products was calculated as the sum of yearly exposures and expressed in Working Level Months (WLM). Cases had a mean cumulative exposure of 552 WLM compared to 420 WLM in controls. Results: There was a statistically significant increase in lung cancer risk for cumulative exposures above 800 WLM. Under the assumption of a linear risk model, there was a significant increase in the relative risk of 0.10 per 100 WLM after adjusting for smoking and asbestos exposure. For current smokers the increase in relative risk was lower (0.05 per 100 WLM), whereas it was higher (0.20 per 100 WLM) among nonsmokers and longtime ex-smokers. After correcting in a sensitivity analysis for the fact that the controls of this study had a higher average exposure than the population of WISMUT workers they were recruited from, the adjusted ERR increased to 0.24 per 100 WLM. Lung cancer risk declined with time since exposure, except for exposures received 45 or more years ago. No inverse dose rate effect was observed.

J	Bhardwaj, N; Bhatnagar, A; Pathak, DP; Singh, AK				Bhardwaj, N; Bhatnagar, A; Pathak, DP; Singh, AK			Dynamic, equilibrium and human studies of adsorption of Tl-201 by Prussian blue	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						adsorption; chelation; Tl-201; nuclear medicine	MEDICAL USE; THALLIUM; EFFICACY; ELIMINATION; ANTIDOTE; ACCIDENT; CHARCOAL; REMOVAL; CS-137; RATS	Prussian blue is the recommended but infrequently required antidote for radiocesium and thallium chemical poisoning. Conceivably, its most frequent application will be the decontamination of radiothallium (thallous chloride) from human body following myocardial scintigraphy. Dosage schedule and physicochemical parameters of interaction with radiothallium, however, need to be defined, as the known data is inadequate on this account. The objective of the present study is to create physiologically relevant and mathematically rigorous data on interaction of Prussian blue with (TI)-T-201, to estimate dosage schedule of Prussian blue suitable for myocardial scintigraphy, and to perform preliminary human studies to evaluate the efficacy of the antidote in reducing the considerable radiation burden imparted by this radiotracer. Adsorption efficacy of Prussian blue for radiothallium was found to be more than 95% at basic (intestinal) pH even at low concentrations and in presence of the physiological cations, potassium and sodium. Isotherm analysis and derivations using Langmuir, Bajpai, Lagergreen, and Freundlich equations suggest a favorable adsorption of 2011 on Prussian blue with q(max) being 5,000 MBq g(-1). Based on these findings and clinical considerations, particularly preferential gall bladder excretion and enterohepatic recycling of radioactive thallous chloride, a dose of 100 mg Prussian blue with every major meal for 3 days was considered adequate for the purpose. Our experience with the first two patients (serving as their own self-controls) suggests that Prussian blue therapy is a safe and effective method to significantly reduce radiation burden imparted by thallium myocardial scintigraphy.

J	Korshukin, M; Emery, RJ				Korshukin, M; Emery, RJ			Reported events of stolen radioactive sources in Texas from 1956 to 2000	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						radioactive materials; quality assurance; emergencies; radiological; operational topics	SECURITY	Incident reports describing stolen source events in Texas from the years 1956 to 2000 were obtained from the Texas Department of Health-Bureau of Radiation Control and recorded into a computerized database using a pre-established set of codes. The data were then analyzed for the identification and characterization of trends. Over the 45-y period of analysis, 113 sources were reported as stolen. The radionuclides most commonly reported in theft events were Am-241, Cs-137, and Ir-192. The proportion of sources including Am-241 as the sole source or Am-241 combined with Be, or as a companion source with Cs-137, represented 56% of the total reported as stolen. Key risk factors identified as associated with source theft appear to include portability status, transportation status, transporter status, and radionuclide type. Based on the observations noted, suggested improved security measures are postulated including additional permitting controls, enhanced inspections, improved locking and storage procedures, and steps for communication to the public to enhance the prospects for recovery. Suggested enhancements to further improve data collection are proposed so that crime prevention information can be derived in future research.

The proton yield was measured as a function of incident He-3 energy and the D depth profile was obtained by deconvolution of the measured proton yields using the program SIMNRA. D atoms diffuse into the bulk at temperatures above 553 K, and accumulate up to a maximum concentration of about 0.2 at.%. At high fluences (>= 10(24) D/m(2)), the accumulation in the bulk plays a major role in the D retention. With increasing exposure temperature, the amount of D retained in B4C increases and exceeds a value of 2 x 10(21) D/m(2) at 923 K. The deuterium diffusivity in the sintered boron carbide is estimated to be D = 2.6 x 10(-6) exp{-(107 +/- 10) kJ mol(-1)/RT}m(2) s(-1). (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Part I - Kinetic study	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							TETRAVALENT ACTINIDE PHOSPHATES; LOW-TEMPERATURE PRECURSORS; SOLID-SOLUTIONS; THORIUM PHOSPHATE; DISSOLUTION KINETICS; RARE-EARTH; CHEMISTRY; MINERALS; MONAZITE; URANIUM	The dissolution of beta-TUPD sintered samples was examined in various conditions of pH, temperature, concentrations of anions in the leachate and leaching flow rates. All the normalized dissolution rates were in the range 10(-7) to 10(-4) g m(-2) day(-1) even in very aggressive media, showing the good resistance of these ceramics to aqueous alteration. The first part of this paper describes several parameters exhibiting a significant influence oil the normalized dissolution rate of the pellets prepared. Both the partial order relative to the proton concentration (n = 0.39-0.41) and the apparent activation energy (E-app = 49 kJ mol(-1)) were found in good agreement with the data reported for powdered samples showing that the sintering process does not degrade the chemical durability of the ceramics. Moreover, due to the high thermodynamical constant of complexation of phosphate species for tetravalent uranium and thorium. the influence of other ligands such as nitrate, chloride or sulphate on the normalized dissolution rates was limited. Near the equilibrium, the increasing of the leaching time, the temperature or the leachate acidity led to the thorium precipitation at the surface of the pellets either in static or in dynamic conditions. Consequently, the dissolution became clearly incongruent and controlled by saturation processes which are described in the second part of this paper. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Part II. Saturation processes	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							LOW-TEMPERATURE PRECURSORS; SOLID-SOLUTIONS; THORIUM PHOSPHATE; URANIUM; SPECTROSCOPY; HYDROGENPHOSPHATE; DISSOLUTION; SPECTRA; TPD; PU	Sintered pellets of thorium-uranium (IV) phosphate-diphosphate solid solutions (beta-Th4-xUx(PO4)(4)P2O7, beta-TUPD) were altered in several acidic media. All the results reported in the first part of this paper confirmed the good chemical durability of the samples. The evolution of the normalized weight loss showed that, in several media, thorium quickly precipitates in a neoformed phosphate-based phase while uranium (IV) is released in the leachate due to its oxidation into the uranyl form. The characterization of neoformed phases was carried out through several techniques involving grazing XRD, infrared and mu-Raman spectroscopies, EPMA, SEM and TEM. SEM micrographics showed that the dissolution mainly occurs at the grain boundaries, leading to the break away of the grains: only the first 15 mu m are altered for 2 months in 10(-1) M HNO3. From EPMA and BET measurements, neither the chemical composition nor the specific surface area are significantly modified. Near equilibrium, two neoformed phases were observed and identified by grazing XRD and/or mu-Raman spectroscopy at the surface of the leached pellets: one is found to be amorphous and progressively turns into the crystallized thorium phosphate-hydrogenphosphate hydrate (TPHPH). From the results obtained, a chemical scheme of the dissolution of beta-TUPD sintered samples is proposed. The behavior of the actinides in the gelatinous phase appears mainly driven by their oxidation state: thorium remains in the tetrapositive state and is quickly and quantitatively precipitated while uranium (IV) is oxidized into uranyl then released in the leachate. The Th-precipitation as TPHPH first appears scattered then covers the entire surface of the pellet, inducing a delay of the actinides release in the leachate. Both phases act as protective layers and should induce the significant delay of the release of actinides (Th, U) to the biosphere. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Whole tritium retained in the bulk of tile could not be released by dry gas purge at high temperature in such a period as one day. Utilization of the isotope exchange reaction using purge gas with hydrogen or humid gas was more effective to release the retained tritium. However, approximately 1% of retained tritium was not recovered by the isotope exchange reaction with dry hydrogen even though such high temperature as 1200 degrees C was applied. Combustion method with oxygen was required to recover all tritium left in the deeper site of the tile. It was observed that combustion of isotropic graphite tile and CFC tile became vigorous at higher temperature than 700 degrees C though the combustion rate was rather slow at 650 degrees C.

In order to develop such a reprocessing process, anodic dissolution experiments were carried out by using a simulated spent fuel pellet in (NH4)(2)CO3 Solution. The dissolution rate constant of the simulated fuel pellet at 323 K was estimated as 3.1 x 10(-6) mol(.)com(-2.)min(-1), which is comparable to that in 5 mol(.)dm(-3) HNO3 solution containing 0.01 mol(.)dm(-3) HNO2 at 323 K. The dissolution rate and the current efficiency for file dissolution of simulated fuel pellet in (NH4)(2)CO3 solution were found to decrease with the elapse of time. Furthermore, in order to examine dissolution behavior, the surface conditions of the pellet before and after the dissolution experiments were analyzed with the scanning electron microscopy and the energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. It was found that neat UO2 matrix exists on the dissolved surface and a decrease in the dissolution rate and the efficiency is caused by the increase in such surface area on the pellet. During the dissolution experiments, precipitates of the simulated fission products were observed on the pellet and in (NH4)(2)CO3 solution used as the electolytic solution. Analyses of the electrolytic solution revealed that most of the simulated fission products, i.e. alkaline earth and rare earth elements, are precipitated in high ratios. From these results it is expected that the anodic dissolution of spent fuels and the separation of fission products by precipitation can be performed simultaneously.

Partitioning behavior of the components according to the applied voltage or current was investigated at various initial U concentrations in a molten salt. Elemental RES concentrations in the cathode deposits increased as the applied voltage decreased at a low initial UCl3 concentration, while they were maintained at a very low level at a higher concentration than similar to 6wt%. Nd2O3 also shows a similar electrochemical behavior with the elemental REs. This means that rare earth oxides which are inherently incorporated in a U ingot call be partitioned during all electrorefining. The dependency of the applied current on the microstructure of the deposit was also discussed. From a variation of the cell resistance according to the rotation speed of the anode, a concentration polarization was detected below 3 wt% of UCl3 in the molten salt, but not above 6 wt%. Pure uranium ingot was obtained after a distillation of the salt from the deposit.

The waste form, which was fabricated from Simulated waste sample by use of in-can type induction-heated melting, consists of two separated phases; a glass phase and a metal phase. Tests were performed for the glass phase from two types of the waste form with different chemical composition at 35 degrees C and S/V ratio of 2,600 m(-1). The glass phase with both types showed an incongruent dissolution similar to conventional high-level radioactive waste (HLW) glasses, i.e., the normalized elemental mass loss (NLi) for soluble elements such as B and Na continued to increase after the saturation of insoluble elements Such as Si, Al and Ca. The NLi for B increased in proportion to the square root of time except for early stage, which suggests that the rate of the long-term dissolution or alteration may be controlled by a diffusion process. Potential secondary phases forming as the results of incongruent dissolution were estimated to be kaolinite and calcite by comparison of the measured solution data with the thermodynamically calculated phase stability relationships. These results suggest that the glass phase has a potential chemical durability not so different from conventional HLW glasses.

Radium-225, which is in equilibrium with its mother Th-229, was used as a yield tracer. Radium were preconcentrated from water samples by coprecipitation with BaSO4 and iron (III) hydroxide at pH 8-9 using ammonia solution, then isolated from uranium, thorium and iron using a Microthene-TOPO chromatography column at 8M HCl, separated from barium in a cation-exchange resin column using 0.05M 1,2-cyclohexylenedinitrilotetraacetic acid monohydrate at pH 8.5 as an eluant, and finally electrodeposited on a stainless steel disc in a medium of 0.17M (NH4)(2)C2O4 at pH 2.6 and current density of 400 mA.cm(-2), and counted by alpha-spectrometry. Optimum experimental conditions for radium separation, purification and electrodeposition have been studied and discussed in the paper. The lower limits of detection of the method are 0.11 mBq.l(-1) for Ra-226, Ra-228 and Ra-224, respectively, if 2 l of water are analyzed. The method has been checked with a certified reference material IAEA-Soil-6 supplied by the International Atomic Energy Agency and reliable results were obtained. Eighteen water samples collected in Italy have been analyzed with the method, the mean radiochemical yields for radium were 86.2+/-6.5%. The obtained radium concentrations were in the range of 0.50-60.8 mBq.l(-1) for Ra-226, of 0.10-25.7 mBq.l(-1) for Ra-228, and of <= LLD-7.97 mBq.l(-1) for Ra-224. The Ra-228/Ra-226 and Ra-224/Ra-226 ratios were in the range of 0.189-4.45 and <= LLD-0.941, respectively.

J	Dewberry, RA; Salaymeh, SR; Casella, VR; Moore, FS				Dewberry, RA; Salaymeh, SR; Casella, VR; Moore, FS			HEU measurements of holdup and recovered residue in the deactivation and decommission activities of the 321-M Reactor Fuel Fabrication Facility at the Savannah River Site	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article								This paper contains a summary of the holdup and material control and accountability (MC&A) assays conducted for the determination of highly enriched uranium (HEU) in the deactivation and decommissioning (D&D) of the Reactor Fuel Fabrication Facility at the Savannah River Site (SRS). The facility was used to fabricate HEU fuel assemblies, lithium-aluminum target tubes, neptunium assemblies. and miscellaneous components for the SRS production reactors. The facility operated for more than 35 years. During this time thousands of uranium-aluminum alloy (U-Al) production reactor fuel tubes were produced. After the facility ceased operations in 1995, all of the easily accessible U-Al was removed from the building, and only residual amounts remained. The bulk of this residue was located in the equipment that generated and handled small U-Al particles and in the exhaust systems for this equipment (e.g., chip compactor, casting furnaces, log saw, lathes A & B, cyclone separator, Freon(TM) cart, riser crusher, ..., etc). The D&D project is likely to represent an important example for D&D activities across SRS and across the Department of Energy weapons complex. The Savannah River National Laboratory was tasked to conduct holdup assays to quantify the amount of HEU on all components removed from the facility prior to placing in solid waste containers. The U-235 holdup in any single component of process equipment must not exceed 50 g in order to meet the container limit. This limit was imposed to meet criticality requirements of the low level solid waste storage vaults. Thus, the holdup measurements were used as guidance to determine if further decontamination of equipment was needed to ensure that the quantity of U-235 did not exceed the 50 g limit and to ensure that the waste met the Waste Acceptance Criteria (WAC) of the solid waste storage vaults. Since HEU is an accountable nuclear material. the holdup assays and assays of recovered residue were also important for material control and accountability purposes. In summary, the results of the holdup assays were essential for determining compliance with the Waste Acceptance Criteria, Material Control & Accountability, and to ensure that administrative criticality safety controls were not exceeded. This paper discusses the gamma-ray assay measurements conducted and the modeling of the acquired data to obtain measured holdup in process equipment, exhaust components, and fixed geometry scrap cans. It also presents development work required to model new acquisition configurations and to adapt available instrumentation to perform the assays.

J	Maxwell, SL				Maxwell, SL			Rapid column extraction method for actinides and Sr-89/90 in water samples	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							SPECTROMETRY	The SRS Environmental Laboratory analyzes water samples for environmental monitoring, including river water and ground water samples. A new, faster actinide and Sr-89/90 separation method has been developed and implemented to improve productivity, reduce labor costs and add capacity to this laboratory. This method uses stacked TEVA Resin(R), TRU Resin(R) and Sr-Resin(R) cartridges from Eichrom Technologies (Darien, IL, USA) that allows the rapid separation of plutonium, neptunium, uranium, americium, curium and thoriurn using a single multi-stage column combined with alpha-spectrometry. By using vacuum box cartridge technology with rapid flow rates, sample preparation time is minimized. The method can be used for routine analysis or as a rapid method for emergency preparedness. Thorium and curium are often analyzed separately due to the interference of the daughter of Th-229 tracer, actinium (Ac-225) on curium isotopes when measured by alpha-spectrometry. This new method also adds a separation step using DGA Resin(R), (diglycolamide resin, Eichrom Technologies) to remove Ac-225 and allow the separation and analysis of thorium isotopes and curium isotopes at the same time.

J	Desideri, D; Feduzi, L; Meli, AA; Roselli, C				Desideri, D; Feduzi, L; Meli, AA; Roselli, C			Leachability of naturally occurring radioactive materials	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							PB-210; NORM; PETROLEUM; EMANATION; SEDIMENTS; INDUSTRY; URANIUM; SAMPLES; EGYPT; SITES	Naturally occuring radioactive materials (NORM) are present in the environment and can be concentrated by technical activities, particularly those involving natural resources. These NORM deposits are highly stable and very insoluble under environmental conditions at the earth's surface. However, reducing or oxidant conditions or pH changes may enable a fraction of naturally occurring radionuclides to eventually be released to the environment. In this paper the leachability of Pb-210 and Po-210 was determined in three samples coming from a refractories production plant (dust, sludge, finished product), in one dust sample from a steelwork and in one ash sample coming from an electric power station. A sequential extraction method consisting of five operationally-defined fractions was used. The average leaching potential observed in the samples from the refractory industry is very low (mean values: 5.8% for Pb-210 and 1.7% for Po-210). The Pb-210 and Po-210 leachability increases for the ash sample coming from an electric power plant using carbon (17.8% for Pb-210 and 10.0% for Po-210); for the dust sample coming from a steelwork. the percent soluble fraction is 41.1% for Pb-210 and 8.5% for Po-210. For all samples the results obtained show that Pb-210 is slightly more soluble than Po-210.

The event studied was a short irradiation, of a small sample of uranium, in a nuclear reactor. Two clocks were investigated, Sr-92-Y-92 and I-135-Xe-135. Measurements of the source by gamma-spectrometry yielded very good agreement between true and measured ages. The upper and lower age limits of applicability for the clocks in question were defined.
