The system consists of a SRAM-based detector and a radiation-tolerant read-out system. The neutron fluence was measured in several locations of the accelerator. Monitoring of the radiation environment in an accelerator tunnel is necessary to assure reliable long-term operation of electronic systems placed in the tunnel. Monitoring of the chamber is especially important during the design stage of a linear accelerator. The new design of 20 GeV linear accelerator X-ray Free Electron Laser (X-FEL) is currently approved for construction at DESY Research Centre in Hamburg [1], [2]. The presented paper is based on our research and experimental measurement carried out at 1.2 GeV superconducting electron linac driving the Vacuum UltraViolet Free Electron Laser (VUV-FEL). The application of a pair of TLD-700 and TLD-500 or superheated emulsion (bubble) dosimeters enables the supervision of neutron fluence in accelera- tors; [3]. This process requires continuous and arduous calibration of TLDs, therefore this method is not convenient. Moreover, it is impossible to monitor the radiation environment in real-time. The presented system fills the market niche of real-time neutron monitoring for high-energy accelerators. Neutron fluence and gamma dose measured in this way can be used for the detailed analysis of the VUV-FEL or X-FEL environments. Monitoring of the radioactive area in a linear accelerator tunnel could be helpful to the diagnosis and reduction of beam losses [4], [5]. We have conducted experiments with the distributed system dedicated to neutron flux measurement at the DESY Research Centre in Hamburg. The devices were exposed to a neutron field from an Americium-Beryllium (n, alpha) source (AmBe)-Am-241. The systems were installed in two accelerators: Linac H and VUV-FEL.

GREAT Collaboration	Verification of the GREAT total data readout system using pseudo random pattern generator	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE			English	Article						data acquisition; pseudo random generator; testing	FILLED RECOIL SEPARATOR; SPECTROMETER	Total Data Readout (TDR) is a powerful data acquisition tool developed for use with Recoil Decay Tagging (RDT) experiments on the GREAT (Gamma, Recoil, Electron, Alpha Tagging) spectrometer. RDT experiments correlate prompt radioactive decays detected at the target position with subsequent decays of recoiling reaction products implanted in GREAT, located at the focal plane of the RITU recoil separator, several microseconds later. TDR uses independent channels associated in a software event builder based on timestamps to form a single time ordered data stream. It is crucial to maintain the accuracy of the timestamps over long periods (microseconds to hours) for the study of Exotic Nuclei. The TDR system cannot be tested fully by use of calibrated sources with GREAT and a novel method of verifying the system is required. Our solution is to use the predictable randomness of a Pseudo Random Number generator based on Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSR) implemented in a 16 channel VME module. The random value defines the delay between pulses into the TDR system. The recorded results are sorted and checked for correspondence with the LFSR sequence. We show the method, design of the module, and discuss the results and benefits of the tests.

Comparison of active interrogation techniques	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE			English	Article						active interrogation techniques; bremsstrahlung; Monte Carlo accelerators; neutron generators		Active interrogation is necessary to detect highly enriched uranium in large cargo containers and trucks. To achieve sufficient penetration, most nuclear techniques first interrogate an object with high-energy photons or neutrons, to produce fission in any highly enriched uranium that may be present, and then detect the gamma rays or neutrons that are produced. Pulsed beams allow the detection of delayed gamma rays or neutrons from fission products between pulses. Many different systems have been proposed recently. This report presents the results for several techniques, both from measurements and from extensive simulations with the MCNPX code.

Irradiation stability of R7T7-type borosilicate glass	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							SODA-LIME GLASSES; FICTIVE TEMPERATURE; MECHANICAL-BEHAVIOR; RADIOACTIVE-WASTE; VITREOUS SILICA; ALPHA-DECAY; RADIATION; SIMULATION; QUARTZ; FORMS	High-level nuclear waste containment glass is subjected to irradiation-induced stresses whose consequences must be assessed to guarantee the material behavior over time. Alpha decay from the minor actinides confined in the glass structure is responsible for most of the atom displacements. Minor actinide concentrations in the glass exceeding current levels are under consideration for future vitrification scenarios. Four R7T7-type borosilicate glass samples doped with 0.04, 0.4, 1.2 and 3.25 wt% (CmO2)-Cm-244 were fabricated to study not only the cumulative effect of high alpha decay doses (> 10(19) alpha/g)but also of the dose rate. The homogeneity of the materials and their chemical compositions were characterized to ensure they were suitably representative for the experimental program. The macroscopic behavior of the glasses was characterized for doses up to 3 x 1018 alpha/g. No significant effect on the initial alteration rate was detected which means that the chemical reactivity of the glass with pure water is not affected by such levels of alpha doses. The glass swelled slightly depending on the dose, saturating at about 0.5% after receiving a dose of about 2 x 1018 alpha disintegrations per gram of glass. The mechanical properties were observed to improve appreciably, with lower hardness but greater fracture toughness. A stabilization phenomenon comparable to that of the glass density was also observed. Comparing the experimental data with other findings obtained by atomistic modeling and external irradiation suggests that nuclear interactions caused by alpha decay recoil nuclei could be responsible for the experimental variations observed. The possible origins of the observed variations in macroscopic properties are also discussed. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Displacement cascade initiated with the realistic energy of the recoil nucleus in UO2 matrix by molecular dynamics simulation	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							RADIATION-DAMAGE; URANIUM-DIOXIDE; IRRADIATED UO2; DEFECTS; SOLIDS	Classical molecular dynamics simulations have been performed to study the primary damage due to alpha-decay self-radiation in UO2 matrix. For the first time a displacement cascade initiated with an energy of 80 keV has been performed. Compared with the cascades initiated with lower energies of the primary knock-on atom (PKA), the morphology of the cascade shows the same features; no amorphisation and creation of point defects are observed. The discrepancy with the linear theory NRT (Norton-Robinson-Torrens) law on the creation of the number of point defects is discussed. However, differences have been found; local and temporary amorphisation appears during the thermal spike over large length scale only in the high energy cascade. Proportionally in the high energy cascade, more linear collision sequences are undergone by the uranium atoms and the oxygen atoms recombine over a larger length scale. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

First-principles study of alloying effect of transition metals on He in titanium ditritide	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							ELECTRONIC POPULATION ANALYSIS; MOLECULAR WAVE FUNCTIONS; HYDROGEN STORAGE ALLOYS; INTERMETALLIC HYDRIDE; BUBBLE FORMATION; IRON CLUSTERS; HELIUM; TRITIDES; LCAO; OVERLAP	Due to its inert reactivity with almost elements, He-3 produced from tritium decay has extremely detrimental effects on the tritide. To refrain from this He-3-induced damage, an efficient way is to increase the stability of He-3 in metal tritide by alloying. Using a first-principles discrete variational method in two cluster models, one for a low He-3 concentration and the other for a high He-3 concentration, the authors study the alloying effect of 3d and 4d transition metals on the stability of He-3 in TiT2 system. It is found that the preferring and metastable sites of He-3 are affected by He-3 concentration : He-3 prefers to stay at original tetrahedral interstitial site when He-3 concentration is low but moves to octahedral site when He-3 concentration is high enough. A criterion of alloying effect is proposed, according to which Nb, Y, Zr, Pd, Ru, Tc, Rh, Cr, Mo and Ag are suggested to be the beneficial alloying elements for increasing the stability of He-3 in the alloyed TiT2 with a low He-3 concentration and Y, Nb, Mo, Zr, Cr, Tc, Ru, Rh and Cu for that with a high He-3 concentration. Our results of alloying effect are supported by the positron annihilation spectroscopy (PAS) measurements for He-implanted Ti, TiMoYAl and TiZrYAl films. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In order to simulate tetravalent minor actinides, the incorporation of thorium, through dry chemical routes, was studied in britholite samples of general formula Ca(9)Nd(1-x)Thx(PO(4))(5-x)(SiO(4))(1+x)F(2). The study showed that the incorporation of thorium was effective whatever the thorium reagent used or the grinding conditions considered. Nevertheless, it appeared necessary to use mechanical grinding (30Hz, 15 min) before heating treatment (T = 1400 degrees C, 6 h) to improve the reactivity of powders and the sample homogeneity. In these conditions, the incorporation of thorium in the britholite structure occurred above 1100 degrees C. The heating treatment at 1400 degrees C led to single phase and homogeneous compounds. This work also underlined the necessity to prefer the coupled substitution (Nd(3+), PO(4)(3-)) double left right arrow (Th(4+), SiO(4)(4-)) instead of (Nd(3+), F(-)) double left right arrow (Th(4+),O(2-)) in order to prepare pure and single phase samples in all the range of composition examined.

Stereological evolution of the rim structure in PWR-fuels at prolonged irradiation: Dependencies with burn-up and temperature	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							MATRIX SWELLING RATE; URANIUM-DIOXIDE; UO2 FUELS; 7.9-PERCENT FIMA; NUCLEAR-FUELS; GAS BEHAVIOR; BUBBLES; RECRYSTALLIZATION; MICROSTRUCTURE; MECHANISMS	The stereology of the rim-structure was studied for PWR-fuels up to the ninth irradiation cycle, achieving maximum local burn-ups of 240 GWd/tM and beyond. At intermediate radial positions (0.55 < r/r(0) < 0.7), a small increase of the pore and grain size of recrystallized areas was found, which is attributed to the increase of the irradiation temperatures in the outer half-pellet-radius due to deterioration of the thermal conductivity. In the rim-zone marked pore coarsening and pore-density-drop occur on surpassing the local burn-up of 100 GWd/tM, associated with cavity fractions of approximate to 0.1. Above this threshold the porosity growth rate drops and stabilizes at a value nearing the matrix-gas swelling-rate (approximate to 0.69%/10 GWd/tM). The rim-cavity coarsening shows ingredients of both Ostwald-ripening and coalescence mechanisms. Despite individual pore-contact events, no clusters of interconnected pores were observed up to maximum pore fractions checked (approximate to 0.24). The rim-pore-structure is found to be well represented in its lower bound by the model system of random penetrable spheres, with percolation threshold at phi(c) = 0.29.

Oxidation behaviour of unirradiated sintered UO2 pellets and powder at different oxygen partial pressures, above 350 degrees C	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							X-RAY-DIFFRACTION; URANIUM-DIOXIDE; FUEL; AIR; GROWTH; NUCLEATION; U3O8	The oxidation of sintered UO2 pellets and powder into U3O8 has been studied by thermogravimetry at 370 degrees C, under controlled oxygen partial pressures (P-O2 ranging from 2 to 40 kPa). Sigmoidal curves of oxidation weight gain were measured for both pellet and powder test samples. The rate of oxidation increased as the oxygen partial pressure increased. It has been shown, by simultaneous TG-DSC, that the reaction proceeds in a pseudo steady state. An experimental methodology based on temperature or P-O2 jumps has shown that the assumption of a rate-limiting step is validated, and a mean value of activation energy for the formation Of U3O8 of 103 kJ mol(-1) was estimated.

J	Olander, DR; Wongsawaeng, D				Olander, D. R.; Wongsawaeng, D.			Re-solution of fission gas - A review: Part I. Intragranular bubbles	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Review							UO2 FUEL; IRRADIATION; NUCLEATION; RELEASE; BURNUP	Theories of fission-fragment-driven re-solution of fission-gas atoms from intragranular bubbles in irradiated UO(2) nuclear fuel are reviewed. Two mechanisms of re-solution are generally accepted: the heterogeneous process destroys entire bubbles in the path of fission fragments and returns the gas to the solid as individual atoms; the homogeneous process re-solves fission-gas atoms singly by scattering collisions with fission fragments and uranium recoils whose paths intersect the bubbles. Coupling of these two re-solution models with the bubble nucleation analogs determines the size and number density of the intragranular bubble population. Two approaches are reviewed: the single-size theory, in which. all bubbles are accorded one size, and the bubble distribution theory, which seeks to determine the variation of bubble number density with size.

J	Roth, O; Nilsson, S; Jonsson, M				Roth, Olivia; Nilsson, Sara; Jonsson, Mats			Radiation enhanced reactivity of UO2	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							OXIDATIVE DISSOLUTION MECHANISM; URANIUM-DIOXIDE; FUEL; OXIDANTS	Pure UO2 is often used as a model compound when studying reactions of importance in a future deep repository for spent nuclear fuel. The reactivity of pure UO2 is not expected to be identical to the reactivity of the UO2-matrix of spent nuclear fuel for several reasons. One reason is that the spent fuel, due to the content of radionuclides, is continuously being self-irradiated. The aim of this study is to investigate how irradiation of solid UO2 surfaces affects their reactivity towards oxidants. The effect of irradiation (gamma or electrons) on the reaction between solid UO2 and MnO4- in aqueous solutions containing carbonate has been studied. It was found that irradiation with high doses (> 40 kGy) increased the reactivity of the UO2 to about 1.3 times the reactivity of unirradiated UO2. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Crystallization of neodymium-rich phases in silicate glasses developed for nuclear waste immobilization	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article							LONG-LIVED RADIONUCLIDES; STRUCTURAL-CHARACTERIZATION; INTERNAL CRYSTALLIZATION; SIO2-AL2O3-CAO GLASSES; CERAMICS; ZIRCONOLITE; ACTINIDES; APATITE; GD; PU	Glass-ceramics containing neodymium-rich crystalline phases can be obtained by crystallization of silicate glasses (nucleation + crystal growth heat treatments) or by controlled cooling of melts. Such materials could be envisaged as durable matrices for conditioning minor actinides- and Pu-rich nuclear wastes if the partitioning ratio of the wastes between crystalline phase and residual glass is high (principle of double containment barrier). In radioactive waste forms, Nd would be partially substituted by actinides and neutron absorbers (Gd). In this work, two silicate glass compositions leading to efficient nucleation and crystallization of either zirconolite (Ca1-xNdxZrTi2-xAlO7,x < 1) or apatite (Ca2Nd8Si6O26) in their bulk were studied as potential waste forms. The effect of the method used to prepare glass-ceramics (controlled cooling from the melt or nucleation + crystal growth from the glass) on both the microstructure and the structure of the neodymium-rich crystalline phase was studied. The highest number of zirconolite or apatite crystals in the bulk was obtained using the nucleation + crystal growth method. However, the percentage of neodymium incorporated in zirconolite crystals remained too small to make realistic the use of such materials for the conditioning of actinides in comparison with more durable bulk ceramics.

J	Sohn, SH; Lee, KJ				Sohn, Soon Hwan; Lee, Kun Jae			Deactivation of hydrophobic Pt/SDBC catalyst in the WTRF LPCE column for tritium separation	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						catalyst; hydrophobic catalyst; liquid phase catalytic exchange; catalyst deactivation; hydrogen isotope; tritium; detritiation; tritium removal facility	ISOTOPE-SEPARATION; EXCHANGE-REACTION; WATER-VAPOR; HYDROGEN; PERFORMANCE; DECAY; GAS	The styrene divinylbenzene copolymer (SDBC) supported platinum catalyst and the liquid phase catalytic exchange (LPCE) column have been developed to be applicable to the Wolsong tritium removal facility (WTRF) in Korea. The catalyst deactivation subject to both reversible uniform poisoning and permanent loss by impurity poisoning was investigated using a time-on-stream theory and a simplified shell progressive poisoning scenario in special case of higher internal diffusion resistance. Experimental data from fixed bed reactors with the Pt/SDBC catalysts have been used to establish the deactivation model and to estimate key parameters to be used in the WTRF LPCE column design. It was found that an impurity control in the streams would be critical to the WTRF LPCE column operation since the impurity poisoning played a very important role in the overall catalytic exchange reaction. Except for the case of the severe impurity poisoning of the whole catalysts, the LPCE column can be in operation over 10 years without any regeneration of the catalysts.

Hundreds strains of microorganisms were screened to establish which microorganisms removed the most uranium. Of the tested microorganism strains, an extremely high uranium removing ability was found in some bacteria, including Lactobacillus sp., which can remove about 2,200 mu mol uranium per gram dry wt. of microbial cells within one hour. These microbial cells can remove uranium from the uranium refining wastewater with a high efficiency. Lactobacillus cells can remove more uranium from seawater than the other microorganisms which have superior uranium removing capacities from non-saline uranium solutions. The Lactobacillus cells immobilized with a polyacrylamide gel have excellent handling characteristics and can be repeatedly used in the adsorption-desorption cycles. The Lactobacillus cells can be used as an adsorbing agent for the removal and recovery of uranium present in nuclear fuel effluents, mine tailings, seawater, and other waste sources.

J	Tsujimura, N; Yoshida, T				Tsujimura, Norio; Yoshida, Tadayoshi			Energy and angular responses of the criticality accident detector using a plastic scintillator	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						criticality accident detector; plastic scintillator; neutron; photon; energy response; angular respouse; Monte Carlo calculation		The Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA), Nuclear Fuel Cycle Engineering Laboratories, operates a spent fuel reprocessing plant and MOX (Plutonium-Uranium Mixed Oxide) fuel fabrication plants. Criticality accident detectors have been installed in these facilities. The detector, the Toshiba RD120, is composed of a plastic scintillator coupled to a photomultiplier tube, and an operational amplifier. The alarm triggering point is set to 1.0-3.6 mGy(.)h(-1) in photon dose rate to detect the minimum accident of concern. However, a plastic scintillator is principally sensitive not only to primary photons but also to neutrons by secondary photons and heavy charged particles produced in the detector itself. The authors calculated energy and angular responses of the RD120 criticality accident detector to photons and neutrons using Monte Carlo computer codes. The response to primary photons was evaluated with the MCNP-4B and EGS4 calculations, and photon and X-ray irradiation experiments. The response to neutrons that produce secondary photons and heavy charged particles from neutron interactions was computed using the MCNP-4B and SCINFUL, respectively. As a result, reliable response functions were obtained. These results will be a great help in reassessing the coverage area and in determining the appropriate triggering dose rate level in criticality accidents.

This means that the weld joint between the body and the lid of the overpack is also required to endure for this period of time. The authors have already started studies on a methodology guaranteeing the long-term integrity of the lid closure, the applicability of several welding and non-destructive examination methods for the weld joint and the corrosion properties of the weld joint. In this paper, through review of the obtained test results, the influences of welding were summarized. Considering the presence of weld flaws, crack growth phenomenon was estimated by fracture mechanics assessment, while the critical crack length and the maximum tolerable flaw size were discussed. Moreover, referring to the Fitness for Service for nuclear power plant components, a method guaranteeing the long-term integrity of the lid closure was discussed and proposed with consideration to the physical and chemical environmental conditions peculiar to the overpack.

In vitro lung dissolutions rates for PuO2	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Nuclear Analytical Methods in the Life Sciences (NAMLS-8)	APR 17-22, 2005	Rio de Janeiro, BRAZIL	Univ Sao Paulo, CENA, Soc Brasileira Metrol			BIOASSAY INTERPRETATION; URANIUM-COMPOUNDS; SOLUBILITY; YELLOWCAKE; INHALATION; FLUID; PARTICLES; SAMPLES	The lung dissolution rates for PuO2 were determined using a 100 day in vitro experiment. A very small amount of the PuO2 rapidly dissolved with a half-time of approximately 10 days, while the majority of the material (> 99%) dissolved with a half-time of approximately 5105 days. This dissolution half time is significantly longer than what is recommended by the ICRP, and would result in higher calculated doses for inhalation intakes of PuO2 than those currently estimated by the ICRP 66 human respiratory tract model for radiological protection.

This project aims at improving the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) TIMS system sensitivity for the analysis of plutonium from environmental samples. The TIMS detection limits for direct, electrodeposition, and resin bead source loading techniques were determined by systematically varying the amount of plutonium loaded on the rhenium filament. It has been shown in our preliminary work that the resin bead could produce a stable TIMS ion beam for as long as 6 h period with approximate to 10(8) Pu atoms loaded onto a single resin bead.

The method makes use of radioactive tracers and a geotechnical centrifuge to accelerate relevant migration processes. A few soil types and tracers have been employed. Experimental data were then compared to those predicted by the advection-dispersion equation. Preliminary results indicate that this alternative method is useful for the determination of the above parameters, especially when fine soils are involved.

The preconcentration method involves the use of a nonionic surfactant and a chelating agent. A fairly small volume of surfactant-rich phase was obtained under optimized experimental conditions. leading to detection limits between 0.3 and 3.0 ng(.)g(-1). Critical parameters that influence extraction efficiency were solution pH and concentration of chelating agent, and to a lesser extent, ionic strength and temperature. Most of the chelates were quantitatively extracted (> 90%) at high pH values. Selective separation can be achieved by varying some of the experimental conditions.

Implementation of alpha-spectrometry for uranium isotopes in excreta samples	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Nuclear Analytical Methods in the Life Sciences (NAMLS-8)	APR 17-22, 2005	Rio de Janeiro, BRAZIL	Univ Sao Paulo, CENA, Soc Brasileira Metrol			THORIUM	The measurement of radioactivity concentrations in excreta is an important tool for the monitoring of possible radionuclide intakes by occupationally exposed workers. For this purpose, a radiochemical procedure for the determination of alpha-emitting isotopes of uranium in excreta has been optimized. The main steps involved in this procedure are pre-concentration, dissolution of sample, separation by ion-exchange resin, electrodeposition and alpha-spectroscopy. U-232 tracer is used to monitor chemical recoveries and correct the results to improve precision and accuracy. The quality control of radiochemical analysis in urine and faecal samples has been performed with participation in intercomparison exercises. The results obtained from these samples, with chemical recoveries (80-95%), are shown to be highly consistent. The method offers good prospects to be applied in routine monitoring programme of workers.

Effect of packing fraction variations on the multiplication factor in pebble-bed nuclear reactors	KERNTECHNIK			English	Article							SPHERES	The effect of fuel element packing density on the effective multiplication factor, k(eff), in a typical pebble-bed reactor (PBR) is studied using MCNP and WIMS computer codes. It is observed that at normal operating conditions keff increases with packing density. Increase in packing density of 1 % results in approximately 0.0015 increase in keff. A negative temperature effect is observed at all feasible packing densities. The effect of secondary coolant (water) ingress in the core at accidental conditions is studied at various packing densities. The effect of effective water density on k(eff) depends on packing fraction, fuel enrichment and fuel-to-graphite ratio. It is strongly positive in highly enriched fuel at low water density regardless of packing fraction. For fuel enrichment 8 % and normal packing density, a maximum positive effect of approximately +0.10 on k(eff) is observed at a water density of similar to 0.1 g/cm(3). The positive effect is reduced at low enrichments. Above a water density of 0.5 g/ cm(3), the effect on k(eff) becomes negative regardless of enrichment and packing density.

Design of a dry cask storage system for spent LWR fuels: radiation protection, subcriticality, and heat removal aspects	KERNTECHNIK			English	Article								Spent nuclear fuel resulting from reactor operation must be safely stored and managed prior to reprocessing and/or final disposal of high-level waste. Any spent fuel storage system must provide for safe receipt, handling, retrieval, and storage of spent fuel. In order to achieve the safe storage, the design should primarily provide for radiation protection, subcriticality of spent fuel, and removal of spent fuel residual heat. This article is focused on the design of a metal-shielded dry-cask storage system, which will host spent LWR fuels burned to 33 000, 45 000, and 55 000 MWd/t U and cooled for 5 or 10 years after discharge from reactor. The storage system is analyzed by taking into account radiation protection, subcriticality, and heat-removal aspects; and appropriate designs, in accordance with the international standards.

These casks are used for an interim dry storage of spent nuclear fuel at Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant. Numerical modeling (calculation of the equivalent dose rates, activities of nuclides, etc.) and experimental measurements of the equivalent dose and gamma spectrum on the cask surface at the dry storage facility were performed for assessment of radiation characteristics. Temperatures were evaluated using only numerical modeling. Rather good agreement between experimentally determined and calculated dose rates for CASTOR RBMK-1500 and CONSTOR RBMK-1500 casks was obtained. Also it was revealed that maximum fuel rod cladding temperature is higher for CONSTOR RBMK-1500 cask, but never exceeds the maximum allowable value. The cask surface temperatures are similar for both cask types.

Nuclear power development in market conditions with use of multi-purpose modular fast reactors SVBR-75/100	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	13th International Conference on Nuclear Energy (ICONE-13)	MAY 16-20, 2005	Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINA					This article presents an innovative nuclear power technology, based on the use of modular type fast-neutron reactors SVBR-75/100 having heavy liquid-metal coolant, i.e. eutectic lead-bismuth alloy, which was mastered in Russia for the nuclear submarines' reactors. Reactor SVBR-75/100 possesses inherent self-protection and passive safety properties that allow excluding of many safety systems necessary for traditional type reactors. Use of this nuclear power technology makes it possible to eliminate conflicting requirements among safety needs and economic factors, which is particularly found in traditional reactors, to increase considerably the investment attractiveness of nuclear power based on the use of fast-neutron reactors for the near future, when the cost of natural uranium is low and to assure development of nuclear power in market conditions. On the basis of the factory-fabricated "standard" reactor modules, it is possible to construct the nuclear power plants with different power and purposes. Without changing the design, it is possible for reactor SVBR-75/100 to use different kinds of fuel and operate in different fuel cycles with meeting the safety requirements. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

J	Mori, M; Maschek, W; Rineiski, A				Mori, Magnus; Maschek, Werner; Rineiski, Andrei			Heterogeneous cores for improved safety performance - A case study: The supercritical water fast reactor	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	13th International Conference on Nuclear Energy (ICONE-13)	MAY 16-20, 2005	Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINA					Light water reactor (LWR) technology is nowadays the most successful commercial application of fission reactors for the production of electricity. However, in the next few years, nuclear industry will have to face new and demanding challenges: the need for sustainable and cheap sources of energy, the need for public acceptance, the need for even higher safety standards, the need to minimize the waste production are only a few examples. It is for these very reasons that a few next generation nuclear reactor concepts were selected for extensive research and development; super critical water reactors are among them. The use of a supercritical coolant would allow for higher thermal efficiencies and a more compact plant design, since steam generators, or steam separators and driers would not be needed, hence achieving a better economy. Moreover, because of the high heat capacity of supercritical water, relatively less coolant would be needed to refrigerate the reactor, therefore the feasibility to design a water cooled fast reactor: the supercritical water fast reactor (SCFR). This system presents unique features combining well-known fast and light water reactor characteristics in one design (e.g. a tendency to a positive void reactivity coefficient together with loss of coolant accident - LOCAs as a design basis accident). The core is in fact loaded with highly enriched MOX fuel (average plutonium content of similar to 23%), and presents a peculiar and significant geometrical and material heterogeneity (use of radial and axial blankets, solid moderator layers, 12 different enrichment zones). The safety analysis of this very complex core layout, together with the optimization of the void reactivity effect through core design, is the main objective of this work. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper a study was made to examine the thermal hydraulic behaviour of the conceptual design of the molten salt advanced reactor transmuter (MOSART) [Ignatiev, V., Feynberg, O., Myasnikov, A., Zakirov, R., 2003a. Neutronic proper-ties and possible fuel cycle of a molten salt transmuter. Proceedings of the 2003 ANS/ENS International Winter Meeting (GLOBAL 2003), Hyatt Regency, New Orleans, LA, USA 16-20 November 2003]. The molten salt fuel is a ternary NaF-LiF-BeF2 system fuelled with ca. 1 mol% typical compositions of transuranium-trifluorides (PuF3, etc.) from light water reactor spent fuel. The MOSART reactor core does not contain graphite structure elements to guide the flow, so the neutron spectrum is rather hard in order to improve the burning performance. Without those structure elements in the core, the molten salt in core flows freely and the flow pattern could be potentially complicated and may affect significantly the fuel temperature distribution in the core. Therefore, some optimizations of the salt flow pattern may be needed. Here, the main attention has been paid to the fluid dynamic simulations of the MOSART core with the code SIMMER-III [Kondo, Sa., Morita, K., Tobita, Y., Shirakawa, K., 1992. SIMMER-III: an advanced computer program for LMFBR severe accident analysis. Proceedings of the ANP' 92, Tokyo, Japan; Kondo, Sa., Tobita, Y., Morita, K., Brear, D.J., Kamiyama, K., Yamano, H., Fujita, S., Maschek, W., Fischer, E.A., Kiefhaber, E., Bucket, G., Hesselschwerdt, E., Flad, M., Costa, P., Pigny, S., 1999. Current status and validation of the SIMMER-III LMFR safety analysis code. Proceedings of the ICONE-7, Tokyo, Japan], which was originally developed for the safety assessment of sodium-cooled fast reactors and recently extended by the authors for the thermo-hydraulic and neutronic models so as to describe the molten salt reactors. For the adaptation to molten salt reactor, a complete equation of state (EOS) for this liquid fuel had to be developed and implemented into the SIMMER-III code. Through those simulations it was concluded that the thermal hydraulic behaviour appeared to be very important in molten salt reactors concerning design, operation and safety. A flow distribution plate design was found effective to optimize the flow pattern in the core region. Further investigations are under way to obtain optimal flow fields without exceeding design limits. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

According to the median forecast of the Special Report on Emission Scenarios commissioned by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Control nuclear power will increase by a factor of four by 2050. The drivers for this expected boost are the increasing energy demand in developing countries, energy security, but also climate concerns. However, staying with a once-through cycle will lead to both a substantially increased amount of high-level nuclear waste and an upward pressure on the price of uranium and even concerns about its availability in the coming decades. Therefore, it appears wise to accelerate the development of fast reactors and efficient re-processing technologies. In this paper, two fast reactor systems are discussed-the sodium-cooled fast reactor, which has already been built and can be further improved, and the lead-cooled fast reactor that could be developed relatively soon. An accelerated development of the latter is possible due to the sizeable experience on lead/bismuth eutectic coolant in Russian Alpha-class submarine reactors and the research efforts on accelerator-driven systems in the EU and other countries. First, comparative calculations on critical masses, fissile enrichments and burn-up swings of mid-sized SFRs and LFRs (600 MW,) are presented. Monte Carlo transport and burn-up codes were used in the analyses. Moreover, Doppler and coolant temperature and axial fuel expansion reactivity coefficients were also evaluated with MCNP and subsequently used in the European Accident Code-2 to calculate reactivity transients and unprotected Loss-of-Flow (ULOF) and Loss-of-Heat Sink (ULOHS) accidents. Further, ULOFs as well as decay heat removal (protected Total Loss-of-Power, TLOP) were calculated with the STAR-CD CFD code for both systems. We show that LFRs and SFRs can be used both as burners and as self-breeders, homogeneously incinerating minor actinides. The tight pin lattice SFRs (P/D = 1.2) appears to have a better neutron economy than wide channel LFRs (P/D = 1.6), resulting in larger BOL actinide inventories and lower burn-up swings for LFRs. The reactivity burn-up swing of an LFR self-breeder employing BeO moderator pins could be limited to 1.3$ in I year. For a 600 MW, LFR burner, LWR-to-burner support ratio was about two for (U, TRU)O(2)-fuelled system, while it increased to approximately 2.8 when (Th, TRU)O(2) fuel was employed. The corresponding figures for an SFR were somewhat lower. The calculations revealed that LFRs have an advantage over SFRs in coping with the investigated severe accident initiators (ULOF, ULOHS, TLOP). The reason is better natural circulation behavior of LFR systems and the much higher boiling temperature of lead. A ULOF accident in an LFR only leads to a 220 K coolant outlet temperature increase whereas for an SFR the coolant may boil. Regarding the economics, the LFR seems to have an advantage since it does not require an intermediate coolant circuit. However, it was also proposed to avoid an intermediate coolant circuit in an SFR by using a supercritical CO(2) Brayton cycle. But in an LFR, the reduced concern about air and water ingress may decrease its cost further. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Concept of innovative water reactor for flexible fuel cycle (FLWR)	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	13th International Conference on Nuclear Energy (ICONE-13)	MAY 16-20, 2005	Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINA					In order to ensure sustainable energy supply in the future based on the matured light water reactor (LWR) and coming mixed oxide (MOX)-LWR technologies, a concept of innovative water reactor for flexible fuel cycle (FLWR) has been investigated in Japan Atomic Energy Research Agency (JAEA). The concept consists of two parts in the chronological sequence. The first part realizes a high conversion type core concept, which is basically intended to keep the smooth technical continuity from current LAIR and coming MOX-LWR technologies without significant technical gaps. The second part represents the reduced-moderation water reactor (RMWR) core concept, which realizes a high conversion ratio over 1.0 being useful for the long-term sustainable energy supply through plutonium multiple recycling based on the well-developed LWR technologies. The key point is that the two core concepts utilize the compatible and the same size fuel assemblies, and hence, the former concept can proceed to the latter in the same reactor system, based flexibly on the future fuel cycle circumstances during the reactor operation period around 60 years. At present, reprocessed plutonium from the LWR spent fuel is to be utilized in MOX-LWR. After this stage, the first part of FLWR, i.e. the high conversion type, can be introduced as a replacement of LWR or MOX-LWR. Since the plutonium inventory of FLWR is much larger, the number of the reactor with MOX fuel will be significantly reduced compared to the MOX-LWR utilization. When the fuel cycle for plutonium multiple recycling with MOX fuel reprocessing is realized, the fuel assembly will be replaced with another type of the tight-lattice one for RMWR with different rod diameter, rod gap width and so forth even in the same reactor system, being flexibly corresponding to the fuel cycle circumstances. Investigation on the core for both the parts of the FLWR concepts has been performed, including the core conceptual design, the core characteristics under Pu multiple recycling, the thermal hydraulic investigation in the tight-lattice core, and so forth. Up to the present, promising results have been obtained. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Reduction of the induced radioactivity in an ADS target by changing the target material isotope composition	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	13th International Conference on Nuclear Energy (ICONE-13)	MAY 16-20, 2005	Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINA					In the paper a possibility of using in a target of an accelerator driven system (ADS) a modified lead-bismuth eutectic (LBE) in which natural lead (Pb-nat) is replaced by a lead isotope, Pb-208, is considered. Spectra of neutrons inside and outside the target consisted from the modified LBEs, Pb-208(80%)-Bi(20%) and Pb-208(90%)-Bi(10%), are calculated using Monte Carlo code. It is shown that in such the targets a harder spectrum of neutrons is realized as compared with the spectrum of the conventional target LBE, Pb-nat(45%)-Bi(55%). The induced activity of such the modified LBE target is reduced due to depleting the material with neutrons of intermediate energy, 10-100 keV and reducing a share of bismuth in the LBE from 55% down to 10-20%.

J	Brinkmann, G				Brinkmann, Gerd			Modular HTR confinement/containment and the protection against aircraft crash	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	13th International Conference on Nuclear Energy (ICONE-13)	MAY 16-20, 2005	Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINA					Does an HTR need a containment - pressure resistant - or is it possible - licensable - to have only a so-called confinement. The answer depends on both the results of the safety analysis of the accidents considered in the design and the acceptance by the licensing authorities and the public of a safety approach only based on severe core damage exclusion. The safety approach to be developed for modular HTRs must describe the application of the defence in depth principle for such reactors. Whatever the requirements on the last confinement barrier could be, a convincing demonstration of the exclusion of any severe core damage is needed, relying on exhaustive and bounding considerations of severe core damage initiators and the use of non-questionable arguments. The paper presents the containment issues for HTRs based on German experience background and considerations for modem modular HTR safety approach including beyond design situations. For the German HTRs (designed in the 80s), it could be shown in the licensing procedures in Germany that there was no need for a pressure retaining and gas tight containment to enclose radioactive nuclides released from the nuclear heat source. Instead, the confinement envelope acted in conjunction with other barriers to minimize the release of radioactive nuclides and the radiological impact on the environment. The confinement envelope consisted of the reactor building, a sub-atmospheric pressure system, a building pressure relief system, an HVAC systems isolation and a filtration system. During a major depressurization accident, unfiltered releases were discharged to the environment. The analyses results show that the environmental impact was far below the dose limits according to the German Radiological Protection Ordinance, even when the effect of filters was not taken into account. The demonstration strongly relied on the assumptions made for the source term definition, e.g. the fuel particles failure rates (under irradiation and during accidental conditions), the diffusion data, the dust data and the deposition/lift-off mechanisms. For modern modular HTRs, the last confinement barrier performances will have to be determined in accordance with the set of accidents to be considered in the design including internal and external hazards and the limits targeted for the public and the environment protection. Further more the paper presents an analysis of effects of a deliberate crash of a large commercial airliner on a former German HTR design, (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A high power liquid hydrogen target for the Mainz A4 parity violation experiment	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						charge conjugation; parity; time reversal; other discrete symmetries; particle sources and targets; polarized and other targets	FORM-FACTORS; SCATTERING	We present a new powerful liquid hydrogen target developed for the precise study of parity violating electron scattering on hydrogen and deuterium. This target has been designed to have minimal target density fluctuations under the heat load of a 20 mu A CW 854.3 Mev electron beam without rastering the electron beam. The target cell has a wide aperture for scattered electrons and is axially symmetric around the beam axis. The construction is optimized to intensify heat exchange by a transverse turbulent mixing in the hydrogen stream, which is directed along the electron beam. The target is constructed as a closed loop circulating system cooled by a helium refrigerator. It is operated by a tangential mechanical pump with an optional natural convection mode. The cooling system supports removal of up to 250 W of beam heating removal. Deeply subcooled liquid hydrogen is used to keep the in-beam temperature below the boiling point. The target density fluctuations are found to be at the level of 10(-3) at a beam current of 20 PA. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Modular design for narrow scintillating cells with MRS photodiodes in strong magnetic field for ILC detector	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						MRS photodiode; calorimeter; magnetic field; extruded scintillator; coincidence trigger; multi-channel	DIGITAL HADRON CALORIMETER; LINEAR COLLIDER DETECTOR	The experimental results for the narrow scintillating elements with effective area about 20 cm(2) are reported. The elements were formed from the single piece of scintillator and were read out via wavelength shifting (WLS) fibers with the Metal/Resistor/Semiconductor (MRS) photodiodes on both ends of each fiber. The count rates were obtained using radioactive source Sr-90, with threshold at about three photoelectrons in each channel and quad coincidences (double coincidences between sensors on each fiber and double coincidences between two neighboring fibers). The formation of the cells from the piece of scintillator by using grooves is discussed, and their performances were tested using the radioactive source by measuring the photomutiplier current using the same WLS fiber. Because effective cell area can be readily enlarged or reduced, this module may be used as an active element for calorimeter or muon system for the design of the future electron-positron linear collider detector. Experimental verification of the performance of the MRS photodiode in a strong magnetic field of 9 T, and the impact a magnet quench at 9.5 T are reported. The measurement method used is described. The results confirm the expectations that the MRS photodiode is insensitive to a strong magnetic field and therefore applicable to calorimetry in the presence of magnetic field. The overall result is of high importance for large multi-channel systems. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Spent-fuel characterization with small CZT detectors	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Review						gamma spectrometry; spent fuel; CZT detector; burn-up		CdTe detectors may be utilised as miniature instruments for the measurement of gamma spectra in safeguards applications [R. Arlt, V. Gryshchuk, P. Sumah, Nucl. Instr. and Meth. A 428 (1999) 127]. This is applicable for measurements both to fresh fuel and irradiated nuclear fuel. The spectrum analysis, however, is more complicated than with Ge detectors. Some reasons are: the peaks are asymmetric, the peak/Compton ratio is low, peak parameters depend on the count rate and on the properties of individual detector crystals. We developed a spectrum-unfolding code for spectra obtained with CdTe detectors. The code makes use of a series of pattern spectra of the individual instrument. It is applied to fission-product spectra and allows the coarse characterisation of the spent fuel in safeguards inspections. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Multiple-particle tracking - an improvement for positron particle tracking	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						PEPT; multiple-particle tracking; location algorithm	PEPT; FLOW; VELOCITIES; FRACTION; CAMERA; MIXER; MODEL; SLIP	The Birmingham positron camera for tracking positron-emitting particles has been successfully applied in a wide range of fundamental research and industrial applications. The technique was developed to track a single tracer; however, tracking multiple particles would provide more comparative information on the physical processes taking place in a system. Here, multiple-particle tracking, a new method that is able to track more than one particle, is presented. The locations of each tracer are calculated in three dimensions by taking account of the radioactivity concentration of each tracer and by discarding corrupted gamma-ray trajectories. The potential applications of the multiple-particle tracking technique are illustrated through two examples by tracking three stationary and three moving particles, respectively.

Production of Am-242m	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Am-242m; nuclear fuel; enrichment	REACTORS; FUEL	The isotope Am-242m is an interesting nuclide as it shows one of the known highest neutron fission cross-section. This could be useful in some special applications, like nuclear reactors for space propulsion, electricity production by direct energy conversion and small-core nuclear reactors. However its availability, in particular at high isotopic abundance, is at present a serious drawback. We have experimentally tested a growth model for the production of Am-242m by means of Am-241(n, gamma) Am-242m reaction in thermal nuclear reactors. The obtained results are found to be in agreement with the model itself. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Using the information from several detectors may improve the accuracy, as obtained by summing the responses from the 3 or 4 detectors. However, even with this improvement, the errors are still very large, up to almost a factor of 10 when the analysis is based on the 92 keV energy peak and up to 7 for the 185 keV peak.

The instruments involved may use some kind of radioactive source, e.g. X-ray fluorescence spectrometry, Mossbauer spectrometry, neutron scattering. Having radioactive sources on a lander/rover poses various potential problems, in regard to both safety to personnel involved in the building of the instrument and to radiation effects on spacecraft structure and on other instruments. Indeed background radiation effects from one instrument may dominate measurements in another resulting in loss of scientific performance. Drawing on experience with the Beagle 2 probe which contained two instruments with radioactive sources, we present a discussion on the management of radiation hazards and background effects posed by radioactive sources for such planetary missions.

Depending on the implantation and annealing conditions, the SiC nanocrystal numbers and average spacing can be controlled by adjusting the implantation and annealing conditions. Typically 300-1000 SiC nanocrystals are produced per 1000 mu m(2) spaced 0.7-1.2 +/- 0.1 mu m. Nuclear reaction analysis measurements using the deuterium induced C-12(d, p)C-13 reaction show that carbon is present in the implanted and annealed samples and varies only to a small degree by the annealing time. However, by not using a liquid nitrogen trap surrounding the targets during implantation, the carbon contamination on the surface reduces the number of SiC nanocrystals and increases their average distance. Specific results are discussed. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Thorium and cerium were used as chemical analogs of minor actinides (Pu and Am). Th is a purely tetravalent element, although Ce can be tetravalent or trivalent. Glass samples were submitted to aqueous leaching tests at 90 degrees C in deionised water for one week, with or without having previously been ionirradiated. The irradiation experiments were conducted in the nuclear energy loss regime. Kr ions supplied by a 1 MV electrostatic Van de Graaff accelerator, were used to produce displacement cascades in the first hundreds of nanometers beneath the sample's surfaces. The leached samples were then characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electron microprobe analysis (EMA) and ion beam analytical (IBA) methods: Rutherford backscattering spectrometry and elastic recoil detection analysis (RBS and ERDA), proton-induced X-ray or gamma ray emission (PIXE and PIGE). Th and Ce are shown to be enriched in the near surface region of leached glasses due to the extremely low solubility of their hydroxides. The effect of surface damage on the chemical behaviour of Th and Ce is then detailed. The possibility for Ce(IV) to be reduced as Ce(IV) during ion-irradiation just before leaching and its consequences on the relative solubility of corresponding chemical species is discussed in terms of hydroxide solubility thermodynamical equilibria.

Reported here is a prototype, the size of a conventional optical microscope, developed at Sandia. The alpha-IPEM, that employs alpha particles from a radioactive source, represents the first example of IBA imaging without an accelerator. The IPEM resolution is currently limited to similar to 10 mu m, but we also report a gridded-phosphor approach that could improve this resolution to that of the optical microscope, or similar to 1 mu m. Finally, we propose that a simple adaptation of the alpha-IPEM could be the only way to maintain the high utility of radiation effects microscopy into the future. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Hydrogen microscopy and analysis of DNA repair using focused high energy ion beams	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION B-BEAM INTERACTIONS WITH MATERIALS AND ATOMS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	17th International Conference on Ion Beam Analysis	JUN 26-JUL 01, 2005	Seville, SPAIN	Univ Autonoma Madrid, Univ Sevilla, Junta Andalucia, Minist Educ & Ciencia, Consejo Superior Investigaciones Cient, Int Atomic Energy Agcy, European Act COST G8, Boem Phys Soc, High Voltage Engn Europa BV, Banco Santander Cent Hispano, Schering Espana			PROTON-PROTON SCATTERING; PHASE-SHIFT ANALYSIS; X-RAY-EMISSION; HEAVY-IONS; NUCLEAR MICROPROBE; MUNICH; MICROIRRADIATION; DEUTERIUM; DIAMOND; CELLS	The ion microprobe SNAKE (Supraleitendes Nanoskop fur Angewandte Kernphysikalische Experimente) at the Munich 14 MV tandem accelerator achieves beam focussing by a superconducting quadrupole doublet and can make use of a broad range of ions and ion energies, i.e. 4-28 MeV protons or up to 250 MeV gold ions. Due to these ion beams, SNAKE is particularly attractive for ion beam analyses in various fields. Here we describe two main applications of SNAKE. One is the unique possibility to perform three-dimensional hydrogen microscopy by elastic proton-proton scattering utilizing high energy proton beams. The high proton energies allow the analysis of samples with a thickness in the 100 mu m range with micrometer resolution and a sensitivity better than 1 ppm. In a second application, SNAKE is used to analyse protein dynamics in cells by irradiating live cells with single focussed ions. Fluorescence from immunostained protein 53BP1 is used as biological track detector after irradiation of HeLa cells. It is used to examine the irradiated region in comparison with the targeted region. Observed patterns of fluorescence foci agree reasonably well with irradiation patterns, indicating an overall targeting accuracy of about 2 mu m while the beam spot size is less than 0.5 mu m in diameter. This performance shows successful adaptation of SNAKE for biological experiments where cells are targeted on a sub-cellular level by energetic ions. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
