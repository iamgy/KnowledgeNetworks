The chromophore maps can be obtained by processing several spectral images of skin, e.g., captured by hyperspectral or multispectral cameras during seconds or even minutes. To avoid motion artifacts and simplify the procedure, a single-snapshot technique for mapping melanin, oxyhemoglobin, and deoxyhemoglobin of in-vivo skin by a smartphone under simultaneous three-wavelength (448-532-659 nm) laser illumination is proposed and examined. Three monochromatic spectral images related to the illumination wavelengths were extracted from the smartphone camera RGB image data set with respect to crosstalk between the RGB detection bands. Spectral images were further processed accordingly to Beer's law in a three chromophore approximation. Photon absorption path lengths in skin at the exploited wavelengths were estimated by means of Monte Carlo simulations. The technique was validated clinically on three kinds of skin lesions: nevi, hemangiomas, and seborrheic keratosis.

The initial period of release and deposition is characterised by high degrees of uncertainty, which is likely to lead to precautionary emergency measures being carried out regardless of the actual dangers to the public, and therefore it is excluded from the optimisation problem. Instead, the analysis is performed on the timescale of weeks, months, years and decades after the accident, implying that the problem is largely deterministic if one disregards long-term economic uncertainties. It is on these longer timescales that economically-driven decisions could be made on whether or not to implement various protection and recovery measures, which include relocation, remediation, repopulation and food banning. Our model allows one to find the joint cost-minimal strategy across the set of measures, providing certain spatial and temporal flexibilities are permitted. Several qualitatively different strategies are identified, including those with no relocation and delayed remediation. Which strategy is optimal depends on the initial radiation levels, the rates and costs of the individual actions, and the preferred economic valuation of the relevant health effects associated with radiation. Our main message is that in many possible settings relocation should be used sparingly and repopulation should be delayed to exploit natural decay of the radioactive elements. These findings could provide useful recommendations to regulators in civil nuclear industry and help devise better policies for implementing emergency response and recovery measures. © 2017 The Authors","77","Economic and social effects","Accidents - Artificial intelligence - Continuous time systems - Decision making - Decision support systems - Nuclear fuels - Nuclear industry - Nuclear power plants - Nuclear reactor accidents - Optimization - Public policy - Radiation effects - Radioactive elements - Radioactivity - Recovery - Uncertainty analysis","Decision making models - Economic uncertainty - Nuclear accidents - Nuclear emergencies - Optimisation problems - Optimisations - Radioactive release - Recovery strategies",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The GO linking layer provides a remarkable analytical platform for bioaffinity binding interface due to its favorable combination of exceptionally high surface-to-volume ratio and excellent optical and biochemical properties. A new GO deposition technique based on chemical-bonding in conjunction with physical-adsorption was proposed to offer the advantages of a strong bonding between GO and fiber device surface and a homogeneous GO overlay with desirable stability, repeatability and durability. The surface morphology of GO overlay was characterized by Atomic force microscopy, Scanning electron microscope, and Raman spectroscopy. By depositing the GO with a thickness of 49.2 nm, the sensitivity in refractive index (RI) of dLPG was increased to 2538 nm/RIU, 200% that of non-coated dLPG, in low RI region (1.333–1.347) where bioassays and biological events were usually carried out. The IgG was covalently immobilized on GO-dLPG via EDC/NHS heterobifunctional cross-linking chemistry leaving the binding sites free for target analyte recognition. The performance of immunosensing was evaluated by monitoring the kinetic bioaffinity binding between IgG and specific anti-IgG in real-time. The GO-dLPG based biosensor demonstrates an ultrahigh sensitivity with limit of detection of 7 ng/mL, which is 10-fold better than non-coated dLPG biosensor and 100-fold greater than LPG-based immunosensor. Moreover, the reusability of GO-dLPG biosensor has been facilitated by a simple regeneration procedure based on stripping off bound anti-IgG treatment. The proposed ultrasensitive biosensor can be further adapted as biophotonic platform opening up the potential for food safety, environmental monitoring, clinical diagnostics and medical applications. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","60","Binding sites","Antibodies - Antigens - Atomic force microscopy - Bins - Biosensors - Chemical analysis - Chemical bonds - Chemical stability - Diagnosis - Fiber bonding - Fiber optic sensors - Graphene - Immunosensors - Medical applications - Optical fibers - Refractive index - Reusability - Scanning electron microscopy","Antibody-antigen - Environmental Monitoring - Graphene oxide nanosheet - Graphene oxides - High surface-to-volume ratio - Label free - Long Period Gratings - Ultra-high-sensitivity","461 Bioengineering and BiologyBioengineering and Biology - 694.4 StorageStorage - 741 Light, Optics and Optical DevicesLight, Optics and Optical Devices - 761 NanotechnologyNanotechnology - 801 ChemistryChemistry - 804 Chemical Products GenerallyChemical Products Generally","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Nanoparticle size is an important parameter that influences the stability, bioavailability and efficacy of the drug. In air-jet atomization technique, dry particle diameters are generally predicted by using solute diffusion models involving the key concept of critical supersaturation solubility ratio (Sc) that dictates the point of crust formation within the droplet. As no reliable method exists to determine this quantity, the present study proposes an aerosol based method to determine Sc for a given solute-solvent system and process conditions. The feasibility has been demonstrated by conducting experiments for stearic acid in ethanol and chloroform as well as for anti-tubercular drug isoniazid in ethanol. Sc values were estimated by combining the experimentally observed particle and droplet diameters with simulations from a solute diffusion model. Important findings of the study were: (i) the measured droplet diameters systematically decreased with increasing precursor concentration (ii) estimated Sc values were 9.3 ± 0.7, 13.3 ± 2.4 and 18 ± 0.8 for stearic acid in chloroform, stearic acid and isoniazid in ethanol respectively (iii) experimental results pointed at the correct interfacial tension pre-factor to be used in theoretical estimates of Sc and (iv) results showed a consistent evidence for the existence of induction time delay between the attainment of theoretical Sc and crust formation. The proposed approach has been validated by testing its predictive power for a challenge concentration against experimental data. The study not only advances spray-drying technique by establishing an aerosol based approach to determine Sc, but also throws considerable light on the interfacial processes responsible for solid-phase formation in a rapidly supersaturating system. Until satisfactory theoretical formulae for predicting CSS are developed, the present approach appears to offer the best option for engineering nanoparticle size through solute diffusion models. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","47","Fighter aircraft","Aerosols - Atomization - Biochemistry - Chlorine compounds - Controlled drug delivery - Diffusion - Diffusion in solids - Drops - Ethanol - Hydrazine - Jets - Nanoparticles - Solubility - Stearic acid - Supersaturation - Surface tension - Time delay","Concentration dependence - Droplet diameters - Droplet evaporation - Equilibrium solubilities - Induction time - Solute diffusion","631.1 Fluid Flow, GeneralFluid Flow, General - 652.1.2 Military AircraftMilitary Aircraft - 713 Electronic CircuitsElectronic Circuits - 761 NanotechnologyNanotechnology - 801.2 BiochemistryBiochemistry - 801.4 Physical ChemistryPhysical Chemistry - 802.3 Chemical OperationsChemical Operations - 804.1 Organic CompoundsOrganic Compounds - 804.2 Inorganic CompoundsInorganic Compounds - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and SolidsPhysical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids - 933 Solid State PhysicsSolid State Physics","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Historically, heavy metal contamination at the Savannah River Site (SRS) in South Carolina has resulted from accidental releases of stored waste generated from nuclear weapon production in the early 1950s. Songbirds inhabiting and using resources from these areas have the potential to bioaccumulate metals but there is limited information on metal concentration levels in areas suspected of contamination as well as uncontaminated sites. Nonlethal tissues samples from avian blood and feathers provide a reliable approach for determining the bioavailability of these pollutants (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb, Se, and Zn). The objectives of this study were to survey terrestrial heavy metal contamination at the SRS on potentially bioavailable contaminated (PBC) sites through blood and feather samples from resident Northern Cardinals (Cardinalis cardinalis) and migratory Great Crested Flycatchers (Myiarchus crinitus) and quantify sex-specific concentrations within species. Samples were collected in April to June of 2016. Cardinals had lower blood concentrations of Hg (β = − 0.17, 85% CL = − 0.26, − 0.09) and Se (β = − 0.33, 85% CL = − 0.50, − 0.16) than flycatchers. Cr feather concentrations were less in cardinals (β = − 1.46, 85% CL = − 2.44, − 0.49) and all feathers of both species from reference locations had significantly less Zn (β = − 67.92, 85% CL = − 128.71, − 7.14). Results indicate flycatchers were exposed to differing heavy metal levels during feather formation on their wintering grounds as compared to their recent exposure (through bloods samples) on their breeding grounds. Sex of individuals did not have a significant impact on bioaccumulation in either species. Overall, metal concentration levels in both species indicate minimal risk for acute toxicity; however, there is limited research on wild passerine populations with similar concentration levels. Therefore, further research on reproductive success of these birds should be explored. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","67","River pollution","Accidents - Bioaccumulation - Biochemistry - Biomarkers - Blood - Contamination - Heavy metals - Land reclamation - Lead - Nuclear weapons - Zinc","Anthropogenic activity - Bioaccumulate - Heavy metal contamination - Migratory - Nonlethal - Passerine - Specific concentration - Surrounding environment","404 Civil Defense and Military EngineeringCivil Defense and Military Engineering - 442.2 Land ReclamationLand Reclamation - 453 Water PollutionWater Pollution - 461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue EngineeringBiological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 461.9 BiologyBiology - 531 Metallurgy and MetallographyMetallurgy and Metallography - 546.1 Lead and AlloysLead and Alloys - 546.3 Zinc and AlloysZinc and Alloys - 801.2 BiochemistryBiochemistry - 914.1 Accidents and Accident PreventionAccidents and Accident Prevention","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In present work the binding abilities of anionic halogen closo-borates [B10Hal10]2−(Hal = Cl, Br, I) and [B12Hal12]2−(Hal = Cl, I) towards bovine and human serum albumins were investigated by spectroscopic and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) methods. The protein fluorescence quenching method and ITC studies confirmed the complex formation. The degree of protein fluorescence quenching increased from chlorine to iodine boron derivatives that is attributed to external heavy atom effect. The ITC data point on the existence in the protein structure of two types of binding sites: with higher and lower affinity to closo-borates. Albumin-closo-borate complex binding ratio, n (4–5 anions per protein molecule) is higher than for the parent hydrogen closo-borates (2 anions per protein molecule). Binding constants estimated by fluorescent and ITC methods indicate higher affinity of halogen closo-borates to albumins (K in the range of 104–106 M−1) comparing to that of the hydrogen closo-borate (K about 103 M−1). Due to their high affinity and high binding ratio to albumins halogen closo-borates are proposed for further studies as agents for boron neutron capture therapy. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","42","Binding sites","Bins - Body fluids - Boron - Bromine - Chlorine - Dyes - Fluorescence - Fluorescence spectroscopy - Iodine - Molecules - Proteins - Quenching","Albumin - Boron cluster compound - Boron neutron capture therapy - Chaotropic properties - Closo-borates - Isothermal titration calorimetry - Protein fluorescence - Protein-ligand interactions","461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue EngineeringBiological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 537.1 Heat Treatment ProcessesHeat Treatment Processes - 549.3 Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals - 694.4 StorageStorage - 741.1 Light/OpticsLight/Optics - 741.3 Optical Devices and SystemsOptical Devices and Systems - 801.2 BiochemistryBiochemistry - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial ChemicalsChemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804 Chemical Products GenerallyChemical Products Generally - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular PhysicsAtomic and Molecular Physics","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The organic chromophore crystallizes from water in its zwitterions exhibiting tabular habit in monoclinic system with acentric space group C2 (Z = 4). The sharp peaks observed in Powder X-ray diffractogram depicts the crystalline nature. The presence of functional groups in the grown crystal was analyzed using FT-IR spectrum. The carbon and hydrogen environment in molecular structure was investigated using FT-NMR technique using deuterated DMSO solution. Ultraviolet–visible spectral analysis reveal that the crystal possess lower cut-off wavelength down to 275 nm, is a key factor to exhibit Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) signal. The direct optical band gap is evaluated to be 5.28 eV from the UV absorption profile. The evaluation of optical constants by employing UV–visible absorbance data such as, extinction coefficient, reflectance, refractive index, optical conductivity are supportive towards good performance as NLO devices. Temperature of decomposition was investigated using thermogravimetric analysis/differential thermal analysis techniques (TG/DTA). The luminescence profile exhibited two peaks (362 nm, 683 nm) due to the donation of protons from carboxylic group to amino group. The nonlinear optical behavior from the noncentrosymmetric crystal was observed by the generation of frequency doubled (2ω) optical radiation when subjected to pulsed Nd:YAG laser (1064 nm, 10 ns, 10 Hz) using Kurtz-Perry method.

The synthesized molecules were well characterized using spectroscopic techniques like UV–Vis, fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (1H &13C) spectroscopy. The compounds were crystalized and their final structures were confirmed after diffracting these on single crystal X-ray diffractometer. The spectroscopic and molecular information were compared with simulated properties calculated via density functional theory (DFT). Geometries of all chalcone compounds have been optimized by density functional theory (DFT) at B3LYP level with 6-311 + G(d,p) basis set combination. Theoretical investigations about UV–Vis and FT-IR spectra of chalcone derivatives were reported using time dependent TD/DFT/B3LYP/6-311 + G(d,p) and B3LYP/6-311 + G(d,p) level respectively. The current study revealed that the theoretical findings complement the experimental results. Nonlinear optical properties of chalcone systems were calculated to gain insights the possibility of designing these compounds as NLO materials. The findings suggested that the first order hyperpolarizability of all the molecules except 1-(4-bromophenyl)-3-(1-methyl-1H-pyrrol-3-yl)prop-2-en-1-oneis also greater than the value of urea (β = 0.372 × 10−30 esu).

Due to the number of -CH groups available in 2,4-dna, the molecular self-assembly continues through C[sbnd]HO intermolecular interactions, which also contribute with the stabilization of the supramolecular network.

These compounds show two central five carbon atom rings, fused in such a way to define a central bicyclo[3.3.0]octa-2,6-diene core. The carbon atoms which fuse both rings have sp3hybridization, then they are not coplanar. A dihedral angle of about 63° corresponds to butterfly conformation. UV–Vis spectra of I and II measured in solution show symmetrical bands centred around 245 nm (Ε ∼ 104 M−1cm−1). These bands are consistent with π→π* transitions. TD-DFT simulated spectra over the DFT optimized in gas phase confirms this hypothesis, and additionally suggest a non-negligible contribution of n→π* transition for II. The slight dependence of λmaxon solvent polarity experimentally observed for II is consistent with some nπ* character. After excitation at 250 nm, a weak emission around 400 nm was detected for both compounds, with quantum yield values below detection limit for I. The value of λemof II was observed to be sensible to the solvent polarity, confirming some relevant n→π* character. The almost fully quenching of the emission of I in solution would be attributed to a rather strong intramolecular hydrogen bond established between the hydroxyl group and the oxo-oxygen atom from tert-butoxy group, which is observed in the crystal structure of the compound (OO ranges from 2.635(2) Å to 2.672(2) Å).

The experimental study was performed on a Na-MMT through the measurements of Stokes size, optical size, scanning electron microscope, atomic force microscope, and dynamic molecule simulation. The results demonstrated that under the effect of interlayer hydration, the Na+that resides near the siloxane surface was moved to the middle plane of interlayer space, and the interlayer spacing was opened 1.38A. Compared with the interlayer hydration, the interlayer spacing was increased only a little (0.32A) treated by isopropanol; meanwhile, the interlayer sheets were joined together by isopropanol molecule.

However, only Co atoms located in the edges of MoS2can create CoMoS phase, so it is a challenge to obtain CoMoS phase with homogeneous distribution limited by the layered MoS2and doping method of Co. Herein, we reported a simple one-pot hydrothermal method to prepare novel ternary CoS2/MoS2/RGO with CoMoS phase for HER using reduced graphene oxide (RGO) as support. XPS proves the formation of CoMoS phase, implying the enhanced activity for HER. RGO support ensures the well distribution of CoMoS phase and enhances the conductivity of CoS2/MoS2/RGO. Compared to CoS2/RGO, MoS2/RGO and CoS2/MoS2, the obtained CoS2/MoS2/RGO shows superior activity for HER with an onset overpotential of −80 mV (vs. RHE), small Tafel slope of 56 mV dec−1, high exchange current density of 11.4 μA cm−2and rigid electrochemical durability. The enhanced performances for HER may be ascribed to the formation of CoMoS phase with high activity and the existence of RGO support with good electrical conductivitys in ternary CoS2/MoS2/RGO. Therefore, the introduction of CoMoS phase and RGO into MoS2could effectively enhance electrocatalytic properties for HER. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","44","Transition metal compounds","Electrocatalysts - Graphene - Molybdenum compounds","CoMoS phase - Electrocatalytic properties - Exchange current densities - Homogeneous distribution - Hydrogen evolution reactions - Hydrothermal methods - Reduced graphene oxides - Reduced graphene oxides (RGO)","761 NanotechnologyNanotechnology - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial ChemicalsChemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804 Chemical Products GenerallyChemical Products Generally","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Samples were characterized by means of TG, XRD, N2adsorption–desorption, pyridine-IR, nitrobenzene-IR, chloroform-IR, and CO2-TPD. Pyridine-DRIFTS measurements evidence two kinds of acid sites in all the samples. Nitrobenzene, chloroform-DRIFTS, and CO2-TPD reveal that there are large amounts of medium-strength base sites on all the metal oxides, and only CaO, ZnO, and γ-Al2O3have strong base sites. And the benzaldehyde selectivity was increased in the same order of the alkalinity of the metal oxides. With weaker sites, ozone molecules form coordinative complexes bound via the terminal oxygen atom, observed by vibrational frequencies at 2095–2122 and 1026–1054 cm−1. The formation of ozonide O3−at 790 cm−1, atomic oxygen at 1317 cm−1, and superoxide O2−at 1124 cm−1was detected; these species are believed to be intermediates of O3decomposition on strong acid/base sites. The adsorption of ozone on metal oxides is a weak adsorption, and other gases, such as CO2, will compete with O3adsorption. The mechanism of cinnamaldehyde ozonation at room temperature over CaO shows that cinnamaldehyde can not only be oxidized into cinnamic acid, but also be further oxidized into benzaldehyde, benzoic acid, maleic anhydride, and ultimately mineralized to CO2in the presence of O3. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","73","Aluminum","Adsorption - Aldehydes - Benzoic acid - Carbon dioxide - Chlorine compounds - Copper oxides - Iron compounds - Metals - Nitrobenzene - Oxygen - Ozone - Ozonization - Pyridine - Zinc oxide","Adsorbed oxygen - Benzaldehyde - Catalytic ozonation - Cinnamaldehyde - Medium strengths - Metal oxides - Situ DRIFT - Weak adsorption","541.1 AluminumAluminum - 802.2 Chemical ReactionsChemical Reactions - 802.3 Chemical OperationsChemical Operations - 804 Chemical Products GenerallyChemical Products Generally","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The degree of conversion values for the materials (DC, %) were immediately measured using near-infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The surface morphology of the composites was investigated by scanning electron microscopes (SEM) and atomic-force microscopy (AFM) analyses. The sorption and solubility measurements were also performed after 1, 7, 15 and 30 days of storage in water. In addition to his, the data were statistically analyzed using one-way analysis of variance, and both the Newman Keuls and Tukey multiple comparison tests.

The system of the fractional neutron point kinetics equations is treated in different context by many authors ignoring an important term related to the derivative of the reactivity. In this paper, we derive a time fractional neutron point kinetics equations (FNPK) model considering a new term for the time derivative of the reactivity. Fractional Leibenz rule is used for such derivation. The effect resulting from the additional term of the reactivity derivative is discussed. It has been found that without this additional term, the modified model will be compliant with the earlier published models for the FNPK. The proposed model of FNPK describes infinite and finite bar reactor cores according to the nonleakage probability and the geometric buckling values. We have applied an effective implicit difference approximation to solve the modified model for finite cylindrical reactor core for both average one group and six groups of delayed neutron precursors.

Altered levels of homocysteine, cysteine, methionine, and glutamic acid have been observed in plasma of ALS patients. In this context, a method for determination of these potential biomarkers in plasma by capillary electrophoresis tandem mass spectrometry (CE-MS/MS) is proposed herein. Sample preparation was carefully investigated, since sulfur-containing amino acids may interact with plasma proteins. Owing to the non-thiol sulfur atom in methionine, it was necessary to split sample preparation into two methods: i) determination of homocysteine and cysteine as S-acetyl amino acids; ii) determination of glutamic acid and methionine. All amino acids were separated within 25 min by CE-MS/MS using 5 mol L−1acetic acid as background electrolyte and 5 mmol L−1acetic acid in 50% methanol/H2O (v/v) as sheath liquid. The proposed CE-MS/MS method was validated, presenting RSD values below 6% and 11% for intra- and inter-day precision, respectively, for the middle concentration level within the linear range. The limits of detection ranged from 35 (homocysteine) to 268 nmol L−1(glutamic acid). The validated method was applied to the analysis of plasma samples from a group of healthy individuals and patients with ALS, showing the potential of glutamic acid and homocysteine metabolites as biomarkers of ALS. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","35","Amino acids","Acetic acid - Biomarkers - Capillary electrophoresis - Electrolytes - Mass spectrometry - Metabolites - Neurodegenerative diseases - Neurons - Organic acids - pH - Proteins - Spectrometry - Sulfur - Sulfur determination","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis - Metabolomics - Protein precipitation - Sample preparation - Tandem mass spectrometry","461.6 Medicine and PharmacologyMedicine and Pharmacology - 461.9 BiologyBiology - 801 ChemistryChemistry - 804 Chemical Products GenerallyChemical Products Generally - 804.1 Organic CompoundsOrganic Compounds - 941.4 Optical Variables MeasurementsOptical Variables Measurements","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

At a moderate V/III ratio, tapered nanowires are obtained, suggesting a strong surface diffusion effect. Dense twin faults are observed perpendicular to the nanowire growth direction due to the fluctuation of In atoms in the droplet originating from the surface diffusion effect. At a lower V/III ratio, the nanowires exhibit kinking, which is associated with a high adhesion due to a large sticking coefficient of TMIn. The twin faults are dramatically suppressed and even completely eliminated in the NW branch after kinking, which is attributed to a stable In supply with a negligible diffusion effect. This work provides a method for the fabrication of defect-free InAs nanowires. © 2017, The Author(s).","28","Nanowires","Catalysis - Diffusion - Metallorganic chemical vapor deposition - Organic chemicals - Organometallics - Surface diffusion","Diffusion effects - Inas nanowires - InP substrates - Kink - Nanowire growth - Self-catalyzed - Self-catalyzed growth - Sticking coefficients","761 NanotechnologyNanotechnology - 802.2 Chemical ReactionsChemical Reactions - 804.1 Organic CompoundsOrganic Compounds - 933 Solid State PhysicsSolid State Physics","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Here, we studied the influence of oxygen vacancies on the magnetoresistance (MR) properties of SrRu1 − xFexO3 - δepitaxial thin films (x = 0.10, 0.20, and 0.30). For this purpose, we synthesized highly strained epitaxial SrRu1 − xFexO3 − δthin films with atomically flat surfaces containing different amounts of oxygen vacancies using pulsed laser deposition. Without an applied magnetic field, the films with x = 0.10 and 0.20 showed a metal–insulator transition, while the x = 0.30 thin film showed insulating behavior over the entire temperature range of 2–300 K. Both Fe doping and the concentration of oxygen vacancies had large effects on the negative MR contributions. For the low Fe doping case of x = 0.10, in which both films exhibited metallic behavior, MR was more prominent in the film with fewer oxygen vacancies or equivalently a more metallic film. For semiconducting films, higher MR was observed for more semiconducting films having more oxygen vacancies. A relatively large negative MR (~36.4%) was observed for the x = 0.30 thin film with a high concentration of oxygen vacancies (δ = 0.12). The obtained results were compared with MR studies for a polycrystal of (Sr1 − xLax)(Ru1 − xFex)O3. These results highlight the crucial role of oxygen stoichiometry in determining the magneto-transport properties in SrRu1 − xFexO3 − δthin films. © 2017, The Author(s).","27","Oxygen vacancies","Deposition - Magnetic field effects - Magnetoresistance - Metal insulator transition - Metals - Oxygen - Pulsed laser deposition - Semiconducting films - Semiconductor doping - Thin films - Transition metal compounds - Transition metals - Transport properties - Vacancies - X ray diffraction","Applied magnetic fields - Atomically flat surface - Epitaxial thin films - Fe-doped - Magneto transport properties - Magnetoresistance properties - Reciprocal space mapping - Transition-metal oxides","531 Metallurgy and MetallographyMetallurgy and Metallography - 701.2 Magnetism: Basic Concepts and PhenomenaMagnetism: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 712.1 Semiconducting MaterialsSemiconducting Materials - 744.9 Laser ApplicationsLaser Applications - 802.3 Chemical OperationsChemical Operations - 804 Chemical Products GenerallyChemical Products Generally - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and SolidsPhysical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids - 933.1 Crystalline SolidsCrystalline Solids","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The cluster included a carbon atom that drifted from an inside octahedral interstice to a tetrahedral interstice in direction and after that in direction to the surface. In addition, one of 14 iron atoms was replaced by a nickel atom, the position of which was changing during simulation. The energy of the nanocluster was estimated at the different interatomic distances. As a result of simulation, the optimal interatomic distances of Fe-Ni-C nanocluster was chosen for the simulation, in which height of the potential barrier was maximal and face-centered cubic (FCC) nanocluster was the most stable. It is shown that there were three main positions of a nickel atom that significantly affected nanocluster’s energy. The calculation results indicated that position of the carbon atom in the octahedral interstice was more energetically favorable than tetrahedral interstice in the case of FCC nanocluster. On the other side, the potential barrier was smaller in the direction than in the direction . This indicates that there are two ways for carbon atom to drift to the surface of the nanocluster. © 2017, The Author(s).","24","Nanoclusters","Atoms - Iron - Lennard-Jones potential - Molecular mechanics - Nickel","Calculation results - Face-centered cubic - Inter-atomic distances - Molecular mechanics method - Nickel atoms - Octahedral interstices - Potential barriers - Tetrahedral interstices","545.1 IronIron - 548.1 NickelNickel - 761 NanotechnologyNanotechnology - 931 Classical Physics; Quantum Theory; RelativityClassical Physics; Quantum Theory; Relativity - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular PhysicsAtomic and Molecular Physics - 933 Solid State PhysicsSolid State Physics","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

However, it is not easy to synthesize such compound because of (i) the instability of the skipping valence state, (ii) the competing charge order, and (iii) that formal valence may not be true in some compounds. In the present study, we show several examples of the valence-skip compounds and discuss how we can design them by first principles calculations. Furthermore, we calculated the electronic structure of a promising candidate of valence skipping compound RbTlCl3from first principles. We confirmed that the charge-density wave (CDW) is formed in this compound, and the Tl atoms in two crystallographic different sites take the valence Tl1+and Tl3+. Structure optimization study reveals that this CDW is stable at the ambient pressure, while this CDW gap can be collapsed when we apply pressure with several gigapascals.

This equation has been adapted for precipitation in ion exchange materials. Both single nanoparticles (2–20 nm) and their aggregates were found in the polymer. Regulation of salt or acid concentration allows us to decrease size of the aggregates approximately in 10 times. Smaller particles are formed in the resin, which possess lower exchange capacity. Sorption of U(VI) cations from the solution containing also hydrochloride acid was studied. Exchange capacity of the composites is ≈2 times higher in comparison with the pristine resin. The organic-inorganic sorbents show higher sorption rate despite chemical interaction of sorbed ions with functional groups of the inorganic constituent: the models of reaction of pseudo-first or pseudo-second order can be applied. In general, decreasing in size of incorporated particles provides acceleration of ion exchange.

In this context, a compromise has to be found between the concentration of Erbium and the glass composition. On the one hand, high concentration of Er3+ions helps to reduce the length of the EDF and hence the cumulated attenuation but generally leads to luminescence quenching mechanisms that limit the performances. On the other hand, so as to avoid such quenching effect, glass modifiers like Al3+or P5+ions are used in the fabrication of commercial EDFs but are not suitable for applications in harsh environment because these glass modifiers are precursors of radiation-induced structural defects and consequently of optical losses. In this work, we investigate the concept of smart doping via material nanostructuring as a way to fabricate more efficient optical devices. This approach aims at optimizing the glass composition of the fiber core in order to use the minimal content of glass modifiers needed to reach the suited level of performances for EDFA. Er3+-doped alumina nanoparticles (NPs), as precursor of Er3+ions in the preform fabrication process, were used to control the environment of rare-earth ions and their optical properties. Structural and optical characterizations of NP-doped preforms and optical fibers drawn from such preforms demonstrate the interest of this approach for small concentrations of aluminum in comparison to similar glass compositions obtained by a conventional technique. © 2017, The Author(s).","31","Erbium doped fiber amplifiers","Alumina - Characterization - Erbium - Erbium compounds - Fabrication - Fiber amplifiers - Fibers - Glass - Ions - Metal ions - Nanoparticles - Optical fiber fabrication - Optical fibers - Optical properties - Photoluminescence - Preforming - Quenching - Rare earths","Conventional techniques - Erbium doped optical fiber amplifier - Luminescence quenching - Nano-structuring - Oxide nanoparticles - Preform fabrication - Radiation-induced absorption - Structural and optical characterizations","531.1 MetallurgyMetallurgy - 537.1 Heat Treatment ProcessesHeat Treatment Processes - 547.2 Rare Earth MetalsRare Earth Metals - 741.1 Light/OpticsLight/Optics - 741.1.2 Fiber OpticsFiber Optics - 744.4 Solid State LasersSolid State Lasers - 761 NanotechnologyNanotechnology - 804.2 Inorganic CompoundsInorganic Compounds - 812.3 GlassGlass - 933 Solid State PhysicsSolid State Physics - 951 Materials ScienceMaterials Science","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In the absence of H2O, the H* treatment demonstrated a cleaning effect of the nanorods, leading to a 0.51 eV upward band bending. In addition, enhancement in the intensity of room temperature photoluminescence (PL) signals due to the creation of new surface defects could be observed. The defects enhanced the visible light activity of the ZnO NRs which were subsequently used to photocatalytically degrade aqueous phenol under simulated sunlight. On the contrary, in the presence of H2O, H* treatment created an electronic accumulation layer inducing downward band bending of 0.45 eV (~1/7th of the bulk ZnO band gap) along with the weakening of the defect signals as observed from room temperature photoluminescence spectra.

The catalytic activity of CA-AuNPs was compared with that of centrifuged CA-AuNPs (cf-CA-AuNPs). Notably, cf-CA-AuNPs exhibited up to 6.41-fold higher catalytic activity compared with CA-AuNPs. The catalytic activity was dependent on the caffeic acid concentration, and the lowest concentration (0.08 mM) produced CA-AuNPs with the highest catalytic activity. The catalytic activities of both CA-AuNPs and cf-CA-AuNPs decreased with increasing caffeic acid concentration.

A monitoring process was established by the Federal Government to ensure that the targets defined for the transformation will be reached. The indicator system developed for that purpose mainly focuses on “classical” environmental, economic and technological indicators for which statistical time series data and political targets are available. Important socio-technical aspects of the energy system and its transition, such as affordability, participation and acceptance, remain largely neglected. This paper aims to contribute to the discussion on indicators needed for political decision-making to appropriately address sustainability aspects of the energy system and its transition, as well as to contribute to improving existing indicator systems. Therefore, the sustainability rules of the Integrative Concept of Sustainable Development were translated into indicators based on an in-depth literature review. The resulting abundance of possible indicators was then reduced using selection criteria such as comprehensiveness, possibility to determine targets and availability of data. Finally, the indicator system was adjusted based on feedback of experts from different disciplines and stakeholder interviews in the particular investigation area of southwest Thuringia. Besides classical indicators related to techno-economic and environmental aspects, the finally developed indicator system includes new sustainability indicators related to the socio-technical interface of the energy system. Thus, it is considered suitable for assessing the sustainability of the Germany energy system and its transition in an integrative and comprehensive way. The indicator system is helpful to systematically identify strengths and weaknesses of the energy system and interdependencies and conflicts of goals between different sustainability aspects. All in all, we believe that applying the indicator system appropriately can support the development of resilient political strategies for a successful energy transition. © 2017, The Author(s).","65","Sustainable development","Climate change - Decision making - Fossil fuels - Indicators (instruments) - Planning","Assessment - Energy systems - Energy transitions - Environmental aspects - Federal governments - Socio-technical aspects - Sustainability assessment - Sustainability indicators","443.1 Atmospheric PropertiesAtmospheric Properties - 912.2 ManagementManagement","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The [200] plane was established to be the most suitable plane for diamond growth, having four carbon atoms arranged in a square and a central vacancy which can be occupied by carbon during thermal-and-pressure treatment. Distances between carbon atoms in the [200] plane differ by only 5% from distances between the carbon atoms of a diamond. The electronic structure and energetic parameters of the substrate were also investigated.

Experiments have shown that changes of frequencies of the most intensive bands arising from the in-plane, E2g1, and out-of-plane, A1g, vibrations, as a function of number n of layers looks differently. Thus, the frequency of ω(A1g) is increasing with growth of n, whereas the frequency of ω(E2g1) is decreasing. Such a change of the ω(E2g1) frequency was explained as the effect of “strong increase of the dielectric tensor when going from single layer to the bulk” sample. In the present work, we show that the reason of different dependences of frequencies can be related to both the van der Waals (vdW) interlayer interaction and the anharmonic interaction of noted fundamental vibrations with the corresponding combination tones (CT) of layer that manifests itself due to Fermi resonance in the layer. Overjumping of these phonon pairs (s, s ') owing to interlayer interaction, V˜(s,s',qp), to other layers at growth of number n, results in the change of frequencies for each interacting pair of A1gor E2g1 symmetry. The alteration of pair frequencies depends on the ratio of constants V˜(s,s',qp) describing the interaction of studied states s and s '. © 2017, The Author(s).","21","Vibration analysis","Molybdenum compounds - Phonons - Raman scattering - Single crystals - Van der Waals forces","Anharmonic interaction - Atomically thin crystals - Dielectric tensors - Fermi resonances - Fundamental vibrations - Interlayer interactions - Layer crystals - Raman scattering spectra","741.1 Light/OpticsLight/Optics - 801.4 Physical ChemistryPhysical Chemistry - 933.1 Crystalline SolidsCrystalline Solids","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The HPT-GWS probe is designed for direct push advancement into unconsolidated formations. The system provides both injection pressure logs and electrical conductivity (EC) logs, and groundwater may be sampled at multiple depths as the probe is advanced (profiling). The combination of these three capabilities in one probe has not previously been available. During field work it was observed that when HPT corrected pressure (Pc) indicates a consistent aquifer unit then bulk formation EC can be used as an indicator of water quality. A high correlation coefficient (R2= 0.93) was observed between groundwater specific conductance and bulk formation EC in the sands and gravels of the alluvial aquifer studied. These results indicate that groundwater specific conductance is exerting a controlling influence on the bulk formation EC of the coarse-grained unit at this site, and probably many similar sites, consistent with Archie's Law. This simple relationship enables the use of the EC and Pclogs, with targeted water samples and a minimum of core samples, to rapidly assess groundwater quality over extended areas at high vertical resolution. This method was used to identify both a brine impacted zone at the base of the aquifer investigated and a groundwater recharge lens developing below storm water holding ponds in the upper portion of the same aquifer. Sample results for trace level, naturally occurring elements (As, Ba, U) further demonstrate the use of this system to sample for low level groundwater contamination. © 2016, National Ground Water Association","40","Recharging (underground waters)","Aquifers - Groundwater - Groundwater pollution - Groundwater resources - Probes - Quality control - Trace elements - Uranium - Water quality","Correlation coefficient - Electrical conductivity - Ground water recharge - Groundwater contamination - Groundwater monitoring - High vertical resolution - Specific conductance - Unconsolidated formations",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Up to now, indium tin oxide (ITO) films have been widely used as transparent conductive electrodes (TCE) in organic opto-electronic devices. However, ITO films, typically deposited on glass are brittle and they make it difficult to produce flexible devices, restricting their use for flexible devices. In this study, we report on a nano-composite TCE, which is made of a silver nanowire (AgNW) network, combined with aluminum-doped zinc oxide (ZnO:Al, AZO) by atomic layer deposition. The AgNWs/AZO composite electrode on photopolymer substrate shows a low sheet resistance of only 8.6 Ω/sq and a high optical transmittance of about 83% at 550 nm. These values are even comparable to conventional ITO on glass. In addition, the electrodes also have a very smooth surface (0.31 nm root-mean-square roughness), which is flat enough to contact the OLED stack. Flexible OLED were built with AgNWs/AZO electrodes, which suggests that this approach can replace conventional ITO TCEs in organic electronic devices in the future. © 2017, The Author(s).","28","Electron devices","Aluminum - Aluminum coatings - Atomic layer deposition - Conductive films - Current density - Deposition - Electric resistance measurement - Electrodes - Electronic equipment - Glass - ITO glass - Light emission - Nanocomposites - Nanowires - Optical films - Optoelectronic devices - Oxide films - Quantum efficiency - Silver - Thermoelectric equipment - Tin oxides - Zinc oxide","Al-doped ZnO - Aluminum-doped zinc oxide - Flexible organic light emitting devices - Organic electronic devices - Organic light-emitting devices - Root mean square roughness - Silver nanowires - Transparent conductive electrodes","541.1 AluminumAluminum - 547.1 Precious MetalsPrecious Metals - 615.4 Thermoelectric EnergyThermoelectric Energy - 701.1 Electricity: Basic Concepts and PhenomenaElectricity: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 708.2 Conducting MaterialsConducting Materials - 741.1 Light/OpticsLight/Optics - 741.3 Optical Devices and SystemsOptical Devices and Systems - 761 NanotechnologyNanotechnology - 802.3 Chemical OperationsChemical Operations - 804.2 Inorganic CompoundsInorganic Compounds - 812.3 GlassGlass - 813.1 Coating TechniquesCoating Techniques - 813.2 Coating MaterialsCoating Materials - 931.4 Quantum Theory; Quantum MechanicsQuantum Theory; Quantum Mechanics - 933 Solid State PhysicsSolid State Physics - 933.1.2 Crystal GrowthCrystal Growth - 942.2 Electric Variables MeasurementsElectric Variables Measurements","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In vitro HL1 and HL2 at 1 mM concentration caused cell specific and time-dependent decrease of leukemic cell viability. Compounds caused the similar gradual decrease of Jurkat cells viability at 72 h (by 35%). HL1 had earlier and more profound toxic effect as compared to HL2 regardless on leukemic cell line.

Toxic effect of HL2 was detected only at 72 h of incubation of Jurkat and Molt-16 cells (cell viability was decreased by 40 and 45%, respectively).

The results indicated that the sealing layer added by ALD significantly decreased the average grain size and improved the corrosion resistance of the CrN coatings.

This work modified the surface of the TNTAs/QDs photoelectrodes with metal-oxide overlayers by atomic layer deposition (ALD), such as coating Al2O3, TiO2, and ZnO. The ALD deposition of all these overlayers can apparently enhance the photoelectrochemical performance of the TNTAs/QDs. Under simulated solar illumination, the maximum photocurrent densities of the TNTAs/QDs with 10 cycles ZnO, 25 cycles TiO2, and 30 cycles Al2O3overlayers are 5.0, 4.3, and 5.6 mA/cm2at 1.0 V (vs. SCE), respectively.

Systematic examination of the effects of various metal-oxide overlayers on the photoelectrochemical performance indicates that the enhancement by TiO2and ZnO overcoatings can only ascribed to the decrease of the interfacial charge transfer impedance, besides which Al2O3coating can passivate the surface states and facilitate the charge transfer kinetics.

The attachment of benzene caused modifications on the total magnetizations of the Cr-MoS2and Mn-MoS2structures. The Bz-Mn@MoS2structure was found to exhibit half-metallicity with 100% spin polarization at the Fermi level.

The response of the liquid crystal to competing surface orientations, typical of patterned substrates, is determined by the anisotropy of the elastic constants and the interplay of the relevant lengths scales, such as the correlation length and the surface geometrical parameters. Transitions between different textures, usually with different symmetries, may occur under a wide range of conditions. We use the Landau-de Gennes free energy to investigate the texture of nematics in sinusoidal channels with parallel anchoring bounded by nematic-air interfaces that favour perpendicular (hometropic) anchoring. In micron size channels 5CB was observed to exhibit a non-trivial texture characterized by a disclination line, within the channel, which is broken into a zigzag pattern. Our calculations reveal that when the elastic anisotropy of the nematic does not favour twist distortions the defect is a straight disclination line that runs along the channel, which breaks into a zigzag pattern with a characteristic period, when the twist elastic constant becomes sufficiently small when compared to the splay and bend constants. The transition occurs through a twist instability that drives the defect line to rotate from its original position. The interplay between the energetically favourable twist distortions that induce the defect rotation and the liquid crystal anchoring at the surfaces leads to the zigzag pattern. We investigate in detail the dependence of the periodicity of the zigzag pattern on the geometrical parameters of the sinusoidal channels, which in line with the experimental results is found to be non-linear. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.","25","Nematic liquid crystals","Anisotropy - Crystal defects - Crystal orientation - Elastic constants - Free energy - Geometry - Liquid crystals - Liquids","Correlation lengths - Elastic instabilities - Landau-de Gennes free energy - Patterned substrates - Sinusoidal channels - Surface orientation - Topological defect - Twist elastic constant","641.1 ThermodynamicsThermodynamics - 921 MathematicsMathematics - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and SolidsPhysical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids - 933.1.1 Crystal LatticeCrystal Lattice","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The particles were powdered using a freeze-dry method and dispersed in poly(vinyl chloride) by melt blending. Dynamic mechanical analysis indicated that the non-crosslinked particles were completely compatible. In contrast, mutual diffusion of the polymer chains in the crosslinked particles was restricted within the particle/matrix interfacial layer. As a result, an incompatible phase structure in which the crosslinked particles were dispersed in the continuous phase was formed. Pulse NMR analysis indicated that the interfacial layer thickness was in the range of 17–98 nm. The thickness decreased with an increase in the degree of crosslinking in the particles. The interfacial layer thickness in the particles was approximately 10 times larger than that for the incompatible polymer pair. Tensile test results indicated that the elongation at break was dependent on the thickness of the interfacial layer.

Therefore, authors of this paper carried out a comparative analysis of TiO2layers produced both using chemical (ALD) and electrochemical (anodic oxidation) methods. The study was performed based on evaluation of electrochemical properties of produced TiO2 layer on the Ti6Al7Nb substrate alloy. As a part of electrochemical properties testing, potentiodynamic, potentiostatic and impedance studies were performed.

The data set presented in this study represents the first complete237Np vertical profiles (0.12–0.27 μBq L− 1), and constitutes a baseline measurement to assess future changes. A similar behavior of Cs and Np has been evidenced, confirming that Np behaves conservatively. While the137Cs decrease has been driven by its radioactive decay, the vertical distribution of237Np has not substantially changed over the last decade. In the absence of recent major inputs, a homogenization of their vertical distribution occurred, partly due to deep convection events that became more intense during the last decade. In contrast,239+240Pu surface levels in the NW Mediterranean waters have fallen in the past four decades by a factor of 5. This decrease in surface has been balanced by higher concentrations in the deep-water layers. A first estimate of the downward239+240Pu fluxes in the NW Mediterranean Sea is proposed over more than two decades. This estimation, based on the DYFAMED sediment trap time-series data and published239+240Pu flux measurements, suggests that sinking particles have accounted for 60–90% of the upper layer (0–200 m) Pu inventory loss over the period 1989–2013. The upper layer residence time of Pu is estimated to be ~ 28 years, twice as long as the residence time estimated for the whole western Mediterranean (~ 15 years). This difference highlights the slow removal of Pu in the open waters of the NW Mediterranean and confirms that most of the Pu removal occurs along the coastal margin where sedimentation rates are high. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","93","Residence time distribution","Nuclear fuels","DYFAMED - Marine tracer - Northwestern Mediterranean - Plutonium isotopes - Vertical exports","922.1 Probability TheoryProbability Theory","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The diagnosis of the different types of neoplasia is made by a specialist through the analysis of histological images. However, these analyses are complex and the same case can lead to different understandings among pathologists, due to the exhaustive analysis of decisions, the time required and the presence of complex histological features. In this context, computational algorithms can be applied as tools to aid specialists through the application of segmentation methods to identify regions of interest that are essential for lymphomas diagnosis. In this paper, an unsupervised method for segmentation of nuclear components of neoplastic cells is proposed to analyze histological images of lymphoma stained with hematoxylin-eosin. The proposed method is based on the association among histogram equalization, Gaussian filter, fuzzy 3-partition entropy, genetic algorithm, morphological techniques and the valley-emphasis method in order to analyze neoplastic nuclear components, improve the contrast and illumination conditions, remove noise, split overlapping cells and refine contours. The results were evaluated through comparisons with those provided by a specialist and techniques available in the literature considering the metrics of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and variation of information. The mean value of accuracy for the proposed method was 81.48%. Although the method obtained sensitivity rates between 41% and 51%, the accuracy values showed relevance when compared to those provided by other studies. Therefore, the novelties presented here may already encourage new studies with a more comprehensive overview of lymphoma segmentation. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","83","Image segmentation","Diseases - Entropy - Fuzzy filters - Genetic algorithms - Image analysis - Object recognition - Oncology - Sensitivity analysis","Computational algorithm - Fuzzy 3-partition - Histological images - Illumination conditions - Lymphoma - Unsupervised segmentation - Valley-emphasis - Variation of informations","461.6 Medicine and PharmacologyMedicine and Pharmacology - 641.1 ThermodynamicsThermodynamics - 723 Computer Software, Data Handling and ApplicationsComputer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 921 MathematicsMathematics","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

With the continual development of information, communication, and sensor technologies, Condition-Based Maintenance (CBM) policies have gained popularity in industries. A successfully implemented CBM reduces the losses due to equipment failure by intelligently maintaining the equipment before catastrophic failures occur. However, effective CBM requires an effective fault analysis method based on gathered sensor data.

One of the important factors influencing the stability of a bacterial structure but also important in the context of an infection is the adhesion force. In order to model the sticking process over time, two theoretical models for bacteria are presented. These models allow to simulate the sticking process numerically. As the model complexity, may affect the calculation time, in this paper we derive two theoretical models of different complexity. One is a simple, adhesive viscous elastic, the other a more complex adhesive viscous elastic-plastic model. Both models can be applied to the simulation of the dynamics of bacteria. Thereby forces act when the bacterium is at a distance to a surface as well as during its contact. The attractive force is described by the van der Waals force by applying an adhesive-dissipative model. For the description of the bacterium within a liquid medium electrostatic double-layer and steric force models are additionally considered. In the attractive-dissipative sticking process viscous damping forces were considered, which results in the theoretically expected load-unload behaviour. The sticking process of a bacterium on a substrate is solved by applying the discrete element method. The bacterium addressed is S. aureus; while as substrate glass is considered. The parameters needed for the numerical simulation of this bacterium are taken from published physical experiments performed with atomic force measurements. Detailed results on the sticking process of the bacterium are presented. A characterisation of the influence of repulsive and attractive forces on the bacterium is given. Obtained results are shown in terms of force displacement diagrams as well as a function of the sticking time history. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","65","Bacteria","Elastoplasticity - Finite difference method - Numerical methods - Numerical models - Van der Waals forces","Atomic force measurements - Dissipative model - Distance to a surface - Elastic -plastic models - Electrostatic double layer - Force-displacement diagrams - Physical experiments - S. aureus","801.4 Physical ChemistryPhysical Chemistry - 921 MathematicsMathematics - 921.6 Numerical MethodsNumerical Methods","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The rolling bearing fault signal calculating model of different location defect is established by failure mechanism analysis, and the simulation vibration signal of the proposed fault model is investigated by FFT and envelope analysis. A comparison has gone to evaluate the performance of bearing defect characteristic extraction for rolling bearings simulation signal by using VMD and EMD. The result of comparison verifies the VMD can accurately extract the principal mode of bearing fault signal, and it better than EMD in bearing defect characteristic extraction. The VMD is then applied to detect different location fault features for rolling bearings fault diagnosis via modeling simulation vibration signal and practical vibration signal.

Molecular dynamics simulations using the Stillinger-Weber (SW) empirical potentials are a useful tool to study the growth of tetrahedral coordinated crystals and the nonequilibrium formation of defects within them, including the long-range effects of strain. SW potentials for the possible atomic interactions among {Ga, In, As, Sb} were developed by fitting to ab initio calculations of elastically distorted zinc blende and diamond unit cells. The SW potentials were tested against experimental observations of molecular beam epitaxial (MBE) growth and then used to simulate the MBE growth of InAs/InAs0.5Sb0.5 T2SL on GaSb substrates over a range of processes parameters. The simulations showed and helped to explain Sb cross-incorporation into the InAs T2SL layers, Sb segregation within the InAsSb layers, and identified medium-range defect clusters involving interstitials and their induction of interstitial-vacancy pairs.

During the GEOTRACES GA04S-MedSeA expedition in 2013 seawater was collected from 10 vertical profiles covering the principal sub–basins of the Mediterranean Sea. The main objective was to understand the distributions of236U and129I in relation to the water masses, and to constrain their sources in this region. The236U/238U atom ratios and the129I concentrations ranged from (710 ± 40) × 10− 12to (2220 ± 60) × 10− 12and from (4.0 ± 0.1) × 107to (13.8 ± 0.3) × 107 at·kg− 1, respectively. The results show that radionuclide–poor Atlantic Water is entering at the surface through the Strait of Gibraltar whereas comparably radionuclide-enriched Levantine Intermediate Water is sinking in the Eastern Basin and flowing westward at intermediate depths. Low radionuclide levels were found in the oldest water masses at about 1000–2000 m depth in the Eastern Basin. At greater depths, waters were relatively enriched in236U and129I due to dense water formation occurring in both, the Eastern and Western Basins. The inventories of236U and129I cannot be explained only by global fallout from atmospheric nuclear bomb testings carried out in the 1950s and 1960s. We estimate that the liquid input of236U from the nuclear reprocessing facility of Marcoule (France), via the Rhône river, was of the same order of magnitude than the contribution from global fallout, whereas liquid and gaseous releases of129I from Marcoule were up to two orders of magnitude higher than global fallout.

In this article, the authors report on ALE of Si, Ge, C, W, GaN, and SiO2using a directional (anisotropic) plasma-enhanced approach. The authors analyze these systems by defining an “ALE synergy” parameter which quantifies the degree to which a process approaches the ideal ALE regime. This parameter is inspired by the ion-neutral synergy concept introduced in the 1979 paper by Coburn and Winters [J. Appl. Phys. 50, 5 (1979)]. ALE synergy is related to the energetics of underlying surface interactions and is understood in terms of energy criteria for the energy barriers involved in the reactions. Synergistic behavior is observed for all of the systems studied, with each exhibiting behavior unique to the reactant-material combination. By systematically studying atomic layer etching of a group of materials, the authors show that ALE synergy scales with the surface binding energy of the bulk material. This insight explains why some materials are more or less amenable to the directional ALE approach. They conclude that ALE is both simpler to understand than conventional plasma etch processing and is applicable to metals, semiconductors, and dielectrics. © 2017 Author(s).","34","Etching","Atoms - Binding energy - Dielectric materials - Germanium","Atomic layer etching - Energy criterion - Material combination - Multistep process - Process approach - Surface binding energies - Ultrathin layers - Underlying surface","549.3 Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals - 708.1 Dielectric MaterialsDielectric Materials - 801.4 Physical ChemistryPhysical Chemistry - 802.2 Chemical ReactionsChemical Reactions - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular PhysicsAtomic and Molecular Physics","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Boiling histotripsy (BH) is applied for mechanical fragmentation of soft tissue into submicron fragments with limited temperature increase using the shock wave and cavitation effects of HIFU. Research on BH has been largely limited to ex vivo experiments. As a consequence, the in vivo pathology after BH treatment and the relation to preexistent tissue characteristics are not well understood. This study reports on in vivo MR guided BH treatment, either with 100 or 200 pulses per focal spot, in three different subcutaneous mouse tumor models: a soft-tissue melanoma (B16OVA), a compact growing thymoma (EL4), and a highly vascularized neuroblastoma (9464D). Extensive treatment evaluation was performed using MR imaging followed by histopathology 2 h after treatment. T2 weighted MRI allowed direct in vivo visualization of the BH lesions in all tumor models. The 100-pulse treated area in the B16OVA tumors was larger than the predicted treatment volume (500 ± 10%). For the more compact growing EL4 and 9464D tumors this was 95 ± 13% and 55 ± 33%, respectively. Histopathology after the 100-pulse treatment revealed completely disintegrated lesions in the treated area with sharp borders in the compact EL4 and 9464D tumors, while for B16OVA tumors the lesion contained a mixture of discohesive (partly viable) clusters of cells, micro-vessel remainings, and tumor cell debris. The treatment of B16OVA with 200 pulses increased the fragmentation of tumor tissue. In all tumor types only micro-hemorrhages were detected after ablation (slightly higher after 200-pulse treatment for the highly vascularized 9464D tumors). Collagen staining revealed that the collagen fibers were to a greater or lesser extent still intact and partly clotted together near the lesion border in all tumor models. In conclusion, this study reveals effective mechanical fragmentation of different tumor types using BH without major hemorrhages. However, treatment settings may need to be adjusted to the tissue characteristics for optimal tissue fragmentation. © 2017","40","Tumors","Ablation - Collagen - Magnetic resonance imaging - Shock waves - Tissue","After-treatment - Cavitation effect - High intensity focused ultrasound - T2-weighted mris - Temperature increase - Tissue characteristics - Treatment volumes - Tumor ablation","461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue EngineeringBiological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 641.2 Heat TransferHeat Transfer - 746 Imaging TechniquesImaging Techniques - 931 Classical Physics; Quantum Theory; RelativityClassical Physics; Quantum Theory; Relativity","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The PbSe films were oxidized at 380°C for 30 min and then iodinated at different iodine vapor pressures at 380°C for 5 min. When the iodine vapor pressure was below 20 Pa, PbSeO3 was the main phase formed on the surface of PbSe microcrystals for both undoped and iodine-doped films. As the iodine vapor pressure was increased above 20 Pa, Pb3I2O2 and PbI2 phases were formed in both types of films and PbSeO3 disappeared in the undoped film.

In the mixtures, both types of methyl groups (that is, molecules of 1 and 2) can be observed independently and simultaneously at low temperatures because the solid state1H spin-lattice relaxation is appropriately described by a double exponential. We have followed the conversion 1 → 2 over periods of two years.

In particular, a new type of mixed-mode oscillations (MMOs) is found in the periodic response.

During steam treatment, pyrolysis products appear to have restrained molecular motions of the steam-heated bamboo, while cleavage of lignin increased molecular motion of the OCH3group. Bamboo treated with pressurized steam retained its hemicellulose and produced a smaller amount of pyrolysis products, while both hemicellulose and lignin were reduced by treatment with NaOH solution.

Among these demands is the frequent need to simultaneously etch features with a wide variety of aspect ratios (AR) on the same wafer. Many plasma etching processes exhibit aspect ratio dependent etching (ARDE) - different etch rates for features that have different aspect ratios, usually slower for larger AR. Processes subject to ARDE require over-etch to clear the larger AR features, which increases the need for high selectivity and low damage. Despite these issues, the physical processes which contribute to ARDE are not well understood. In this paper, results are discussed from a computational investigation on the root causes of ARDE during Ar/Cl2plasma etching of Si, and, in particular, the role which neutral transport plays in this process. Parametric studies were performed varying neutral-to-ion flux ratios, surface recombination rates of atomic Cl, and neutral and ion angular distributions to determine their influence on neutral transport of Cl to the etch front and ARDE. It was found that each parameter has a significant influence on neutral transport to the etch front (with the exception of the ion angular distribution). Methods for increasing neutral flux (for a given set of ion fluxes) to the etch front were found to push the system toward a neutral saturated, ion starved regime which alleviates ARDE for some range of AR. Increased neutral flux is also correlated with more tapered features, which tend to exhibit more significant ARDE. This coupling of neutral transport with feature profiles makes it difficult to alleviate all ARDE in this system. However, it is possible to optimize parameters in such a way to postpone the onset of ARDE to fairly large AR (>8). © 2017 American Vacuum Society.","45","Aspect ratio","Alpha particles - Angular distribution - Ions - Plasma etching - Semiconductor device structures - Semiconductor devices - Silicon wafers","Aspect ratio dependent etchings - Computational investigation - Ion angular distribution - Neutral transport - Plasma etching process - Surface recombinations - Three dimensional (3D) structures - Unprecedented demand","714.2 Semiconductor Devices and Integrated CircuitsSemiconductor Devices and Integrated Circuits - 802.2 Chemical ReactionsChemical Reactions - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular PhysicsAtomic and Molecular Physics","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In this area, spatial variability of arsenic is high, peaking at 241 μg/L. Forty-seven percent of samples collected contained arsenic above the maximum allowable concentration for drinking water (10 μg/L). Correlations of As with other hydrochemical variables were investigated using multivariate statistical analysis (Hierarchical Cluster Analysis, HCA and Principal Component Analysis, PCA). It was found that As, V, Cr and pH are closely related and that there were also close correlations with temperature and Na+. The highest concentrations of arsenic and other associated Potentially Toxic Geogenic Trace Elements (PTGTE) are linked to alkaline NaHCO3waters (pH ≈ 9), moderate oxic conditions and temperatures of around 18 °C–19 °C. The most plausible hypothesis to explain the high arsenic concentrations is the contribution of deeper regional flows with a significant hydrothermal component (cold-hydrothermal waters), flowing through faults in the basement rock. Water mixing and water-rock interactions occur both in the fissured aquifer media (igneous and metasedimentary bedrock) and in the sedimentary environment of the CDB, where agricultural pollution phenomena are also active. A combination of multivariate statistical tools and hydrochemical analysis enabled the distribution pattern of dissolved As and other PTGTE in groundwaters in the study area to be interpreted, and their most likely origin to be established.
