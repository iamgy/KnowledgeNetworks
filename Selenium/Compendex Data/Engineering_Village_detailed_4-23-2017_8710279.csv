The extraction solvent is then dispersed as fine droplets in the cloudy sample through manual or mechanical agitation. Hence, the sample is centrifuged to break the formed emulsion and the extracting solvent is manually separated. The organic solvents commonly used in DLLME are halogenated hydrocarbons that are highly toxic. These solvents are heavier than water, so they sink to the bottom of the centrifugation tube which makes the separation step difficult. By using solvents of low density, the organic extractant floats on the sample surface. If the selected solvent such as undecanol has a freezing point in the range 10–25 °C, the floating droplet can be solidified using a simple ice-bath, and then transferred out of the sample matrix; this step is known as solidification of floating organic droplet (SFOD). Coupling DLLME to SFOD combines the advantages of both approaches together. The DLLME-SFOD process is controlled by the same variables of conventional liquid-liquid extraction. The organic solvents used as extractants in DLLME-SFOD must be immiscible with water, of lower density, low volatility, high partition coefficient and low melting and freezing points. The extraction efficiency of DLLME-SFOD is affected by types and volumes of organic extractant and disperser, salt addition, pH, temperature, stirring rate and extraction time. This review discusses the principle, optimization variables, advantages and disadvantages and some selected applications of DLLME-SFOD in water, food and biomedical analysis. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","144","Extraction","Drops - Emulsification - Freezing - Liquids - Organic solvents - Solidification - Solvent extraction - Solvents","Dispersive liquid liquid microextraction(DLLME) - Dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction - Extraction efficiencies - Halogenated hydrocarbons - Liquid-liquid extraction - Microextraction - Optimization variables - Solidification of floating organic droplets","802.3 Chemical OperationsChemical Operations - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial ChemicalsChemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The purpose is to provide the detailed information on heat transfer behaviors for better understanding the abnormal heat transfer mechanism of supercritical fluid in rolling motion. It concludes that the effect of rolling motion on the supercritical CO2is much more notable than that on conventional single-phase fluid. The rolling motion can cause the periodic oscillation of the local heat transfer coefficients and suppress the whole heat transfer deterioration. As supercritical CO2temperature or mass flux increases, the influences of rolling motion and flow direction on the heat transfer decrease markedly. The secondary flow induced by the rolling motion for upward flow is stronger than that for downward flow, and the influence of rolling motion on the left and right sides of the tube is more obvious than on other locations. The heat transfer deterioration phenomenon weakens gradually as the rolling period decreasing or rolling amplitude increasing. It is important to note that the rolling motion may bring about the large wall temperature oscillation and the wall peak temperature increment to influence the safety of high-pressure pipeline. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","41","Heat transfer","Carbon dioxide - Computer simulation - Deterioration - Effluent treatment - Heat exchangers - High pressure effects - High pressure pipelines - Oscillating flow - Supercritical fluids","Double-pipe heat exchangers - Flow distribution - Heat transfer behavior - Heat transfer deterioration - Heat transfer mechanism - Local heat transfer coefficient - Numerical investigations - Rolling motion","452.4 Industrial Wastes Treatment and DisposalIndustrial Wastes Treatment and Disposal - 616.1 Heat Exchange Equipment and ComponentsHeat Exchange Equipment and Components - 619.1 Pipe, Piping and PipelinesPipe, Piping and Pipelines - 631.1 Fluid Flow, GeneralFluid Flow, General - 641.2 Heat TransferHeat Transfer - 723.5 Computer ApplicationsComputer Applications - 804.2 Inorganic CompoundsInorganic Compounds - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and SolidsPhysical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids - 951 Materials ScienceMaterials Science","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Co-incubation with LC managed to prevent these alterations and also reverted the changes in NADPH oxidase expression triggered by Ang II. Cell signalling studies evidenced that LC did not modify Ang II-induced phosphorylation of Akt, p38 MAPK or ERK1/2.

In some of these targets, the requirement of reaching high yield production of secondary particles points out to the use of high density materials. The interaction of the beam with the atoms and nuclei of these materials produce extremely fast depositions of energy, highly soliciting them from thermo-structural point of view due to subsequent rise of temperature and pressure waves. Iridium is a good candidate material since exhibits very high density, high melting point, good strength and stability at high temperature, and resistance to thermal shock. The main goal of this study is the investigation of the mechanical behaviour at different temperatures and strain-rates in tensile loading condition of pure iridium. A series of tests at room temperature at different strain-rates (from 10−3s−1up to 104s−1) was performed in order to obtain information about strain and strain-rate sensitivity of the material.

Emotions can significantly influence the way that reviews are processed. The importance of discrete emotions embedded in online reviews and their impact on review helpfulness is not explored intensively in prior studies. This study builds a helpfulness predictive model using deep neural network and investigates the influences of emotions that contribute to review helpfulness. We present an approach that extract novel discrete positive and negative emotion features from textual content of product reviews using NRC emotion Lexicon. In addition, the type of product, reviewer, visibility, readability, linguistics and sentiment related characteristics are also used for comparison and helpfulness prediction. The experimental results on two real-life datasets demonstrate that positive emotion features are the best predictors when individual category of feature is considered. However, negative emotion features and visibility features have comparable performance. Furthermore, the hybrid set of features with positive emotion features produce the best predictive performance for helpfulness of online reviews. The empirical evaluation finds that Trust, Joy and Anticipation (positive emotions); Anxiety and Sadness (negative emotions) are most influential emotion dimensions and have greater impact on perceived helpfulness. The findings of this study highlight the importance of emotions in online reviews and have significant implications for consumer and e-commerce retailers. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","64","Behavioral research","Commerce - Decision making - Deep neural networks - Electronic commerce - Linguistics - Sales - Visibility","Discrete emotions - Empirical evaluations - Positive and negative emotions - Predictive modeling - Predictive performance - Search products - Trust emotion - Word of mouth","723.5 Computer ApplicationsComputer Applications - 741.2 VisionVision - 912.2 ManagementManagement - 971 Social SciencesSocial Sciences","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The physicochemical properties and biochemical composition of the material's surface regulates osseointegration. This study investigates how collagen into biomimetic matrixes affects hydroxyapatite (HAp) growth. Collagen was inserted into insoluble Langmuir monolayers containing either 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) or octadecylphosphonic acid (OPA) and transferred to titanium (Ti) supports by means of the Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) technique. The resulting films served as matrixes for HAp growth upon exposure of Ti discs to SBF. Scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, vibrational spectroscopy in the infrared region, X-ray diffraction, and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy aided characterization of the samples. Properties such as wettability, roughness, and surface free energy were also studied. The biocompatibility of the samples was investigated by osteoblast viability assays in vitro. Collagen interacted with DPPC and OPA at the air/water interface as evidenced by the pressure surface isotherms and the compressional modulus. Moreover, collagen in the subphase increased the stability of the phospholipid monolayer at high organization degree. Collagen incorporation into DPPC LB films induced formation of biomimetic HAp nanoparticles that resembled the HAp nanoparticles found in natural bone. Enhanced cell proliferation on the modified-Ti surfaces demonstrated that the coatings were not toxic to osteoblasts.

The novel HA-MWCNTs were characterized using TEM, FT-IR, BET and XRD analysis. The TEM and SAED results revealed that the MWCNTs were uniformly encapsulated by hydroxyapatite nanoparticles. The synthesized HA-MWCNTs had a high specific surface area (180.504 m2 g−1), with an average pore width (14.607 nm) and pore volume (0.774 cm3 g−1), which produced a defluoridation capacity (DC) of 30.22 mgF− g−1. This value was greater than unmodified hydroxyapatite (HA), which exhibited a larger specific surface area (172.233 m2 g−1) and an excellent DC of 17.80 mgF− g−1. A number of pertinent parameters that could affect the defluoridation performance of the HA/MWCNTs including weight ratios of the two key materials, solution pH and competing anions were carefully and comprehensively examined. It was found that the adsorption results followed the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm model, and the sorption kinetics of the F−appeared to exhibit a pseudo second order. Moreover, the adsorption reaction was spontaneous and endothermic and appeared to exhibit a higher initial adsorption rate. This reaction appeared to occur result from both anion exchange and electrostatic interactions. When the HA-MWCNTs (MH6) were at an adsorbent dose of 2.0 g L−1, they were able to decrease the fluoride concentration of actual nuclear industry wastewater from 8.79 mg L−1to about 0.25 mg L−1(97.15% removal efficiency).

The “Generic Containment” activity was performed in the frames of the EU-FP7 project SARNET2 to investigate the influence of user effect and computer code choice on the results on the nuclear power plant scale. During this activity, a Generic Containment nodalisation was developed and used for exercise by the participants applying various computer codes. Even though the model of the Generic Containment and the transient scenario were precisely and uniquely defined, considerably different results were obtained not only among different codes but also among participants using the same code, showing significant influence of the user effect. This paper present analysis, which is an extension of the “Generic Containment” benchmark and investigates the effect of input parameter's uncertainties in comparison to the user effect. Calculations were performed using the computer code ASTEC, the uncertainty and sensitivity of the results were estimated using GRS method and tool SUSA. The results of the present analysis show, that while there are differences between the uncertainty bands of the parameters, in general the deviation bands caused by parameters’ uncertainty and the user effect are comparable and of the same order. The properties of concrete and the surface areas may have more influence on containment pressure than the user effect and choice of computer code as identified in the SARNET2 Generic Containment activity.

This paper aims to provide new insight toward the design of radial turbines for operation with sCO2in the 100-200 kW range. The quasione- dimensional mean-line design code TOPGEN is enhanced to explore and map the radial turbine design space. This mapping process over a state space defined by head and flow coefficients allows the selection of an optimum turbine design, while balancing performance and geometrical constraints. By considering three operating points with varying power levels and rotor speeds, the effect of these on feasible design space and performance is explored. This provides new insight toward the key geometric features and operational constraints that limit the design space as well as scaling effects. Finally, review of the loss break-down of the designs elucidates the importance of the respective loss mechanisms. Similarly, it allows the identification of design directions that lead to improved performance.

Monte Carlo simulations were done to compute collision probabilities and impact energies at each intersection. Possible safety improvement measures through a proper selection of operational transport parameters were investigated. These parameters include shipment routes, ship's cruise velocity, number of transport casks carried in a shipment, the casks’ stowage configuration and loading order on board the ship. A shipment case study is presented. Waters with high collision probabilities were identified. Effective range of cruising velocity to reduce collision risks were discovered.

An almost invisible glow occurs just above the inception voltage. Corona phenomenon is mainly used in electro-technological processes to obtain space charge for electrostatic precipitation, separation of different particles, electrostatic liquid or solid coating, neutralization of space charge, etc. All of these processes rely on a strong nonhomogeneous electric field generated by a point – plate electrode system. When the critical value of the applied voltage is reached, the ionization processes near the point electrode start and give rise to the current between two electrodes. If the pointed electrode is positive, it is possible to observe an anomaly of the current – voltage (I-U) characteristic for the point-plate space. It means that while the voltage is raising the current density decreases in a narrow voltage area (2–3 kV). The anomaly was technically named as negative differential conductivity (dI/dU < 0). Unstable current can have a negative influence on electro-technological processes. The anomaly was detected for different shapes and materials of the electrode as well as for various temperatures and distances between electrodes. An oxidation layer, which appears on the metal electrode, also influences the ionization processes near the pointed electrode and causes a decrease of a current. In this paper measuring of the discharge activity in a point – plate electrode system is presented. Ionization of gas atoms and molecules in a high electric field and the following recombination of electrons and positive ions in the corona region can give rise to high-energy photons which produce new electrons in the field of discharge.

Study of the statics of the system shows that compact CuN(3≤N≤8) clusters made up of triangular units on fcc occupancy sites are the energetically most stable structures of those clusters. Interestingly, we find a correlation between the height of the activation energy barrier (Ea) and the location of the transition state (TS). The Eaof processes for Cu islands on the Ni(111) surface are in general smaller than those of their counterpart Ni islands on the same surface. We find this difference to correlate with the relative strength of the lateral interaction of the island atoms in the two systems. While our database consists of hundreds of possible processes, we identify and discuss the energetics of those that are the most dominant, or are rate-limiting, or most contributory to the diffusion of the islands. Since the Eaof single- and multi-atom processes that convert compact island shapes into non-compact ones are larger (with a significantly smaller Eafor their reverse processes) than that for the collective (concerted) motion of the island, the later dominate in the system kinetics – except for the cases of the dimer, pentamer and octamer. Short-jump involving one atom, long jump dimer-shearing, and long-jump corner shearing (via a single-atom) are, respectively, the dominating processes in the diffusion of the dimer, pentamer and octamer. Furthermore single-atom corner-rounding are the rate-limiting processes for the pentamer and octamer islands. Comparison of the energetics of selected processes and lateral interactions obtained from semi-empirical interatomic potentials with those from density functional theory show minor quantitative differences and overall qualitative agreement. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","63","Diffusion barriers","Activation energy - Atoms - Chemical activation - Density functional theory - Diffusion - Energy barriers - Kinetics - Monte Carlo methods - Nickel - Shearing","Diffusion kinetics - Heteroepitaxial systems - Kinetic Monte Carlo - Lateral interactions - Rate-limiting process - Semi-empirical interatomic potential - Single atoms - Stable structures","548.1 NickelNickel - 604.1 Metal CuttingMetal Cutting - 641.1 ThermodynamicsThermodynamics - 804 Chemical Products GenerallyChemical Products Generally - 922.2 Mathematical StatisticsMathematical Statistics - 931 Classical Physics; Quantum Theory; RelativityClassical Physics; Quantum Theory; Relativity - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular PhysicsAtomic and Molecular Physics","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

A test where all three gas circulators were tripped at 30% reactor power (9 MW) without a reactor scram, called a loss-of-forced-cooling (LOFC) test, was analyzed, and the analytical results from a reactor kinetics code was reported. After that, the Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA) acquired a large supercomputer and the STAR-CCM+ software developed by CD-adapco, which can be used to create a three-dimensional model of the HTTR to analyze steady-state and transient conditions. In this paper, a model of the three-dimensional thermal-hydraulics inside the reactor pressure vessel (RPV) during the LOFC test at 30% reactor power (9 MW) is described and detailed analyses are performed using STAR-CCM+. With this tool, the effects of natural and forced convection on thermal-phenomena in the HTTR can be understood quantitatively. The finding is as follows: the downstream of forced convection caused by the helium purification system (HPS) pushes down the upstream by natural convection in the fuel assemblies; however, the forced convection due to the HPS has little influence on the core thermal-hydraulics without the reactor outlet coolant temperature. And the effect can be neglected because the difference of the maximum velocity of the helium between the cases where the HPS is active and inactive, is very little over the course of LOFC test. The proposed three-dimensional analytical model will be useful for three-dimensional accident analyses. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","20","High temperature reactors","Cooling - Forced convection - Fuel purification - Helium - High temperature engineering - Hydraulics - Nuclear reactors - Pressure vessels - Safety engineering - Stars - Supercomputers","Forced cooling - HTGR - HTTR - Safety demonstration tests - Thermal hydraulics - VHTR","619.2 TanksTanks - 621.1 Fission ReactorsFission Reactors - 632.1 HydraulicsHydraulics - 641.2 Heat TransferHeat Transfer - 657.2 Extraterrestrial Physics and Stellar PhenomenaExtraterrestrial Physics and Stellar Phenomena - 722.4 Digital Computers and SystemsDigital Computers and Systems - 804 Chemical Products GenerallyChemical Products Generally - 914 Safety EngineeringSafety Engineering","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

All pipe spools were fabricated using identical pipeline production procedures for manufacturing multipass narrow gap welds. Nondestructive neutron diffraction (ND) strain scanning was carried out on girth welded pipe spools and strain-free comb samples for the determination of the lattice spacing. All residual stress measurements were carried out at the KOWARI strain scanning instrument at the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organization (ANSTO). Residual stresses were measured on two pipe spools in as-welded condition and two pipe spools after local and furnace PWHT. Measurements were conducted through the thickness in the weld material and adjacent parent metal starting from the weld toes. Besides, three line-scans along pipe length were made 3 mm below outer surface, at pipe wall midthickness, and 3 mm above the inner surface. PWHT was carried out for stress relief; one pipe was conventionally heat treated entirely in an enclosed furnace, and the other was locally heated by a flexible ceramic heating pad. Residual stresses measured after PWHT were at exactly the same locations as those in as-welded condition. Residual stress states of the pipe spools in as-welded condition and after PWHT were compared, and the results were presented in full stress maps. Additionally, through-Thickness residual stress profiles and the results of one line scan (3 mm below outer surface) were compared with the respective residual stress profiles advised in British Standard BS 7910 'Guide to methods for assessing the acceptability of flaws in metallic structures' and the UK nuclear industry's R6 procedure. The residual stress profiles in as-welded condition were similar. With the given parameters, local PWHT has effectively reduced residual stresses in the pipe spool to such a level that it prompted the thought that local PWHT can be considered a substitute for global PWHT.

The investigation consists of computing three-dimensional flow in a representative centrifugal compressor with and without PS at various levels of approximations in flow physics and geometrical configuration; this provides an enabler for establishing the causal link between PS flow effects and compressor performance changes. It is shown that the main flow path perceives the PS flow as a combination of flow actuations that include injection and removal of mass flow and injection of axial momentum and tangential momentum. A computational model in which the presence of the PS is replaced by imposed boundary conditions (BCs) that reflect the individual flow actuations has thus been formulated and implemented. The removal of a fraction of the inducer mass flow has been determined to be the dominant flow actuation in setting the performance of PS compressors. Mass flow removal reduces the flow blockage associated with the impeller tip leakage flow and increases the diffusion in the main flow path. Adding swirl to the injected flow in the direction opposite to the wheel rotation results in an increase of the stagnation pressure ratio and a decrease of the efficiency. The loss generation in the flow path has been defined to rationalize efficiency changes associated with PS compressor operation. © 2017 by ASME.","20","Centrifugal compressors","Actuators - Centrifugation - Efficiency - Leakage (fluid) - Mass transfer","Compressor performance - Computational model - Geometrical configurations - Stagnation pressures - Tangential momentum - Three-dimensional flow - Tip leakage flow - Turbocharger centrifugal compressors","618.1 CompressorsCompressors - 641.3 Mass TransferMass Transfer - 732.1 Control EquipmentControl Equipment - 802.3 Chemical OperationsChemical Operations - 913.1 Production EngineeringProduction Engineering","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

We investigated adsorption of important species involved in these reactions, activation barrier and reaction energy of H-assisted dissociation mechanism, directly dissociation of CO, and HCO insertion reactions (CHx + HCO → CHxCHO (x = 1–3)) on four Cu-Co surface models.

This cask damage probability was investigated over various transport parameters which include the number of transport casks carried per shipment, cask stowage configuration, cask loading direction, and ship's cruise velocity. Collision case studies are presented by using reference models of the SNF package, the struck and striking ship. Most and least vulnerable stowage locations on the SNF ship were discovered. The number of casks in a shipment and their stowage method which suppressed cask damage probabilities were identified.

We find that for one-cycle laser pulse, the PADs of O2molecule are inversion asymmetric, and the PADs are not dependent on the photoelectron energy. For two-cycle and three-cycle laser pulses, although the PADs are still inversion asymmetric, the PADs have a certain dependence on the photoelectron energy. According to this phenomenon, we can control the emission directions of photoelectrons by choosing a fitted photoelectron energy. At same time, with a fitted photoelectron energy, by changing the carrier-envelope (CE) phase, the split position of the PADs of O2molecule can be controlled, and then can forecast the main emission direction of photoelectron.

In this study, we presented an efficient, facile and environment-friendly strategy to produce polymer-FONs, which relied on the self-polymerization of dopamine and polyethyleneimine (PEI) in rather mild conditions. To obtain the final polymer-FONs, aldehyde group-containing copolymers (named as poly(UA-co-PEGMA)) were synthesized by reversible addition–fragmentation chain-transfer polymerization using polyethylene glycol methyl ether methacrylate (PEGMA) and 1-undecen-10-al (UA) as monomers. The dopamine was conjugated onto poly(UA-co-PEGMA) through a multicomponent reaction between UA and dopamine to obtain poly(UA-co-PEGMA)-DA, which was further utilized for preparation of polymer-FONs through self-polymerization of dopamine and PEI.1H nuclear magnetic resonance, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy were employed to characterize the structure, morphology, compositions and optical properties of these polymer-FONs. Cell viability and cell uptake behavior results suggested that these polymer-FONs possess good biocompatibility and can be potentially utilized for biomedical applications.

These comacromers and crosslinked polymer products were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Raman mapping techniques. SEM and EDAX analysis substantiate high invitro bioactivity of the polymer products. SEM studies depict a distinct macroporous structure with pore size of 50 to 300 μm. These crosslinked hybrid products demonstrated no significant difference in compressive moduli after 4 weeks immersion in SBF. In particular, the compressive moduli were found to be comparable with that of trabecular bone. We suggest that the formation of an apatite layer on the surface of the composites deter initial degradation leading to better mechanical stability. As expected, the polymer products displayed negligible degradation in SBF during the first 4 weeks which increased to a maximum of 25% by the end of the 8 weeks time period. In addition these crosslinked products which are hydrophilic exhibit favorable albumin adsorption, cell viability, HOS cell adhesion and exemplary compatibility.

Under the conditions studied, 4 h bake time and 210 °C with an alkali to concentrate ratio (A/C) of 4:1 allowed for relatively high REEs extraction while maintaining relatively low thorium and uranium extraction, which may allow for at least partial separation of REEs from thorium and uranium. At this level, and with an average particle size of 81 µm, more than 90% of REEs were extracted, uranium extraction dropped to ∼38% by partly reporting to the water leach solution, and thorium extraction was consistently low at ∼25%. Baking temperature (180–250 °C) was found to have a pronounced effect on the extraction of REEs, uranium, and thorium. The maximum extraction of REEs was achieved during the 210 °C, 3 h bake time test. Thorium extraction was greater than 90% in the 2 h bake time at 210 °C, then dropped drastically to 50% or less for the 3 and 4 h bake times. Uranium extraction preferred the 250 °C level, but remained fairly low for the vast majority of the levels tested. The effect of particle size (48–137 μm) was studied at 210 °C and was found to have some effect on the extraction in the 1 and 2 h tests. However, in the 3 and 4 h tests, extractions were of similar magnitude for all three particle sizes studied. Thorium extraction peaked during the 2 h test and then dropped in 3 and 4 h tests. Alkali consumption was calculated and found to increase with increasing temperature and decreasing particle size (0.01–0.22 g alkali/g concentrate). Alkali consumption was increased with increasing extraction. The drop off in extraction is attributed to the dehydration of the hydroxides produced and the formation of insoluble phosphate phases. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","12","Chemicals removal (water treatment)","Extraction - Leaching - Monazite - Particle size - Phosphate minerals - Rare earths - Testing - Thorium - Uranium - Uranium metallurgy","Alkali pug - Average particle size - Baking temperature - Increasing temperatures - Partial separation - Rare earth elements (REEs) - Rare earths elements - Uranium extraction","482.2 MineralsMinerals - 547 Minor, Precious and Rare Earth Metals and AlloysMinor, Precious and Rare Earth Metals and Alloys - 549.3 Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals - 802.3 Chemical OperationsChemical Operations - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial ChemicalsChemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804 Chemical Products GenerallyChemical Products Generally - 804.2 Inorganic CompoundsInorganic Compounds","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

To overcome this problem of the FEM we have applied Mesh Free (MFree) method for the solution of the neutron transport equation. In mesh free technique, there is no need to regenerate finer meshes to ensure the accuracy of the solution and only the number of nodes in local domains is increased. MFree method is flexible for distributing arbitrary and irregular nodes, therefore this method can be easily applied for high absorbent regions in the nuclear reactor problems. We have developed a program, named SNMF, which solves discrete ordinate neutron transport equation, using mesh free techniques based on Radial Point Interpolation Method (RPIM). To validate SNMF program some test problems have been modeled. For the first time, the application of MFree method is examined to solve neutron transport equation.

Adsorption energies of the species derived from ammonia and molecular hydrogen and their stable sites were obtained. It was shown that the adsorption process type and energy depend on the position of Fermi level at the surface. Hydrogen decomposes into two separate H atoms, always adsorbed in the positions on top of the surface Ga atoms (On-top). Ammonia adsorption at GaN(0001) surface proceeds molecularly to ammonia in the On-top position or dissociatively into NH2radicals in bridge (NH2-bridge) or On-top positions or into NH radicals in H3 (NH-H3) site. Presence of these species affects Fermi level pinning at the surface due to creation of new surface states. The Fermi level pinning in function of the surface attached species concentration was determined using extended electron counting rule (EECR). Results of ab initio calculations fully proved validity of the EECR predictions. Thermodynamic analysis of the surface in equilibrium with molecular hydrogen and ammonia vapor mixture is made giving the range of ammonia and hydrogen pressures, corresponding to Fermi level pinned at Ga-broken bond state for NH-H3&H and NH3&H and NH2-bridge&H coverage and at VBM for NH3& H coverage. As the region of Fermi level pinned at Ga broken bond state corresponds to very low pressures, at pressures close to normal, GaN(0001) surface is almost totally covered by H, NH3and NH2located in On-top positions. It is also shown however that dominant portion of the hydrogen and ammonia pressures corresponds to Fermi level not pinned.

The adsorption energy calculations and electronic properties analysis suggest that there is a strong interaction between O2molecule and defective system. The adsorbed O2on the defective surface can dissociate with a lower activation energy barrier, which produce two active oxygen atoms.

According to total energy calculations, average binding energy per ZnO monomer of the surface nuclei was analyzed to investigate if the nucleation and growth will proceed reasonably in physics.

By using atomistic thermodynamics analysis, we calculated the Gibbs free energy of formation of these nuclei and made a comparison between the two polar surfaces. On (0001)-Zn surface, the critical Gibbs free energy of formation is much lower than that on (0001¯)-O surface under the same supersaturation, which leads to a much larger ZnO growth rate and rougher morphology, in accordance with experimental results.

Thereafter, the hydrolysis of carboxybetaine ester into zwitterionic groups brought about anti-adhesive properties against bacteria and proteins. The surface chemical composition and wettability performance of the PU network surfaces were investigated by attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and contact angle analysis. The surface distribution of PDMS and zwitterionic segments produced an obvious amphiphilic heterogeneous surface, which was demonstrated by atomic force microscopy (AFM).

The new grid plate consisted of two joined cubic with empty walls which are place of fuels and heavy water, respectively. The proposed design is such that the reactor core is divided into two distinct parts using the heavy water. The heavy water is inserted in the walls of the new grid plate. The new design of grid plate by keeping the characteristics of the previous version creates the possibility of shutting the reactor down in critical condition. In this paper, at initial step, a simulation of acceptable benchmark for Tehran research reactor is performed which could be considered reliable and comparable with SAR (Safety Analysis Report) data. In the next step, two different designs are proposed for grid plate and then are applied to reactor core using simulation tools. For the proposed design: core excess reactivity, shutdown margin, control rod worth, neutron flux and kinetic parameters are calculated. Furthermore, the transient analysis was performed for the new design to check the status of reactor safety. Obtained results show that all neutronic parameters for the first operating core and the new design are comparable, and there is no reduction in the efficiency of reference core. Moreover, in the current design, a diverse and independent shutdown system for TRR was included. Nuclear reactor analysis codes including MTR-PC package were employed to carry out these calculations. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","25","Reactor cores","Heavy water - Nuclear reactors - Reactor shutdowns - Research reactors - Transient analysis","Control rod worth - Critical condition - Excess reactivity - Grid plates - Nuclear reactor analysis - Safety analysis reports - Shutdown systems - Tehran research reactors","621 Nuclear ReactorsNuclear Reactors - 804 Chemical Products GenerallyChemical Products Generally","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

An increase in threshold current (Ith) and a concomitant decrease in threshold voltage (Vth) and resisitivity(ρ) have been observed with the increase of Sb content. Raman spectra of the switched region in memory switching compositions show a red shift with respect to the as prepared glasses whereas in threshold switching compositions no such shift is observed. The magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS NMR) of27Al atom shows three different environments for Al ([4]Al,[5]Al and[6]Al). The samples annealed at their respective crystallization temperatures show rapid increase in[4]Al sites by annihilating[5]Al sites. The melts of threshold switching glasses (x≤2.5) quenched in water at room temperature (27 °C) show amorphous structure whereas, the melt of memory switching glasses (x>2.5) solidify into crystalline structure. The higher coordination of Al increases the cross-linking and rigidity. The addition of Sb increases the glass transition(Tg) and decreases the crystallization temperature(Tc). The decrease in the interval between the Tgand Tceases the transition between the amorphous and crystalline states and improves the memory properties. The temperature rise at the time of switching can be as high as its melting temperature and the material in between the electrodes may melt to form a filament. The filament may consists of temporary (high resistive amorphous) and permanent (high conducting crystalline) units. The ratio between the temporary and the permanent units may decide the switching type. The filament is dominated by the permanent units in memory switching compositions and by the temporary units in threshold switching compositions.

Optical characterizations included lens efficiency (Solar Simulator instrument), material transmittance and haze (of coupons cut from veteran lenses, then measured again after their faceted back surface was polished, and then measured again after the incident front surface was polished), and direct transmittance (as a function of detector's acceptance angle, using the Very Low Angular Beam Spread (“VLABS”) instrument). Lens efficiency measurements compared the central region to the entire lens, also using hot and cold mirror measurements to diagnose differences in performance. A series of subsequent characterizations was performed because a decrease in performance of greater than 10% was observed for some of the veteran lenses. The optimal focal distance of the lenses was quantified using the Solar Simulator, and then correlated to lens curvature using a recently developed measurement technique.

The dichroic signal strength at the L2, 3-edge of ferromagnetic Cobalt (Co) is estimated on theoretical grounds using a single atom scattering approach. To justify this approach, multi-slice simulations were carried out in order to confirm that orbital angular momentum (OAM) is conserved in amorphous materials over an extended range of sample thickness and also in very thin crystalline specimen, which is necessary for the detection of EMCD.

Among other biomaterials, self-assembling peptides are appealing systems due to their ability to spontaneously form nanostructured hydrogels that can be directly injected into lesions. Indeed, self-assembling peptide scaffolds are expected to behave as biomimetic matrices able to surround cells, to promote specific interactions, and to control and modify cell behavior by mimicking the native environment as well. We selected three pentadecapeptides inspired by Human Tropoelastin, a natural protein of the extracellular matrix, expected to show high biocompatibility. Moreover, the here proposed self-assembling peptides (SAPs) are able to spontaneously aggregate in nanofibers in biological environment, as revealed by AFM (Atomic Force Microscopy). Peptides were characterized by XPS (X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy) and IRRAS (Infrared Reflection Absorption Spectroscopy) both as lyophilized (not aggregated) and as aggregated (nanofibers) samples in order to investigate some potential differences in their chemical composition and intermolecular interactions, and to analyze the surface and interface of nanofibers. Finally, an accurate investigation of the biological properties of the SAPs and of their interaction with cells was performed by culturing for the first time human Mesenchymal Stem Cells (hMSCs) in presence of SAPs.

Nevertheless, their heterogenic, anisotropic and brittle nature make difficult to characterise the machining process and therefore, an in-depth understanding of the cutting mechanics is needed. In this regard, this paper aims to understand the different behaviours of CMCs while employing orthogonal cutting. The first part of this article proposes a novel theoretical approach to explain the different types of cutting behaviours (fracture and shear cutting) based on the inelastic and orthotropic properties of the CMC's by using a high imaging system and measuring the cutting forces. The second part aims to understand the cutting and fracture mechanism by developing for the first time a specific analytical model for each of the three main orthotropic orientations, defined by the three main relative fibre orientations respect to the feed direction, which are found in cutting of CMCs. This is approached by the calculation of the specific cutting energy needed to fracture the CMC's during cutting (energy release rate, Gc) using fracture mechanics and cutting theories. This analytical model has been successfully validated for a Carbon/Carbon composite with the experimental data obtained for the brittle cutting and by introducing the concept of a rising R-curve in cutting models. Moreover, comparing the results obtained for the energy release rate for the brittle and semi-ductile mode, it is observed that the material experiences an important change in the energy release rate according to the brittle-to-semi-ductile transition occurring while reducing the depth of cut. Finally, a novel monitoring method based on the vibrations of the sample has been found successful to understand the type of crack formation appearing while cutting CMCs. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","32","Ceramic matrix composites","Analytical models - Carbon - Carbon carbon composites - Ceramic materials - Composite materials - Crack initiation - Cracks - Cutting tools - Energy release rate - Fracture - Fracture mechanics - Machining","Fibre orientation - Fracture mechanisms - In-depth understanding - Monitoring methods - Novel theoretical approaches - Orthogonal cutting - Orthotropic properties - Specific cutting energy","415.4 Structural Materials Other Than Metal, Plastics or WoodStructural Materials Other Than Metal, Plastics or Wood - 603.2 Machine Tool AccessoriesMachine Tool Accessories - 604.2 Machining OperationsMachining Operations - 804 Chemical Products GenerallyChemical Products Generally - 812.1 CeramicsCeramics - 921 MathematicsMathematics - 931.1 MechanicsMechanics - 951 Materials ScienceMaterials Science","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

T2relaxation was measured at 24 h post mortem (p.m.) and again after 9 days of chilled storage. NMR measurements from day 1 p.m. were limited in predicting day-9 purge (|r| = 0.37–0.52). The root mean square error of linear regression (RMSD) for measuring day-9 purge using the relaxation time of intra-myofibrillar water (T21) measured on day 1 p.m. (r = −0.46) was 1.31% (range: 1.15–7.69% purge), corresponding to ±2.62% (2 × RMSD) prediction error of purge with 95% probability. This indicated that for purge production rate, the distribution and mobility of water in meat on day 1 p.m. may be of little relevance. Further tests were conducted to explain this poor predictability, by taking NMR measurements of water mobility and distribution made on the same meat sample (taken at 96 h p.m.) every day, during a 9-day storage period. By analyzing the T21and T22domains every day, it was revealed that during the first 5-day of storage, water (86%) moved from intra-myofibrillar space to extra-myofibrillar space. However, this movement did not result in detectable drip. A major liquid loss followed between days 6 and 7 and ceased day 8. This complexity of the water movement between domains during storage may explain the poor predictability of day-9 purge using NMR measurements from day 1. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","24","Food storage","Energy storage - Forecasting - Mean square error - Meats - Nuclear magnetic resonance - Purging","Distribution and mobility - NMR measurements - Porcine longissimus dorsi - Prediction errors - Production rates - Root mean square errors - Water holding capacity - Water movements",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

A platinum catalyst, deposited accurately at a truncated AFM tip by ion beam-induced deposition (IBID), was used for localized nanowire synthesis. It could be shown that the deposition of a thin silicon dioxide layer prior to the catalyst deposition resulted in controlled SiNW growth on silicon as well as silicon nitride probes. In addition, a FIB-based method for post-growth alignment of the fabricated SiNW tips is presented, which allows tilt-compensation specifically tailored to the specifications of the used AFM instrumentation.

This transition from multilayer to monolayer requires atomic-layer-precision thining of thick MoSe2layers without damaging the remaining layers. Here, we present atomic-layer-precision thinning of MoSe2nanaosheets down to monolayer by using SF6 + N2plasmas, which has been demonstrated to be soft, selective and high-throughput.

By adjusting the etching rates we can achieve complete MoSe2removal and any disired number of MoSe2layers including monolayer.

Fluorine, chlorine, and bromine atoms occupy the oxygen defect sites of TiO2, decreasing the stability of noble metal atoms on the surface. This decrease occurs because the halogens inhibit electron transfer from TiO2to the noble metal atoms; the electron transfer from reduced TiO2to the noble metal atom stabilizes the noble metal atom adsorption. In contrast, iodine strengthens the interactions between TiO2and some noble metal atoms, namely Ag and Cu. This stabilization occurs because of the covalent interaction between iodine-doped TiO2and the noble metal atom. Therefore, the stabilization is explained well by chemical hardness.

Layer-by-layer (LbL) thin films are attractive for incorporating controlled amounts of growth factors and releasing them over time. Herein, we investigated the effect of a method of cross-linking of albumin/heparin layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly ((Alb/Hep)3) on the loading and release of basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2), and subsequent proliferation of human endothelial cells (HUVECs). The (Alb/Hep)3assemblies were cross-linked using glutaraldehyde, reductive amination or carbodiimide chemistries, and then biofunctionalized with FGF-2. The (Alb/Hep)3assemblies were characterized by the infrared multi-internal reflection spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, ellipsometry, and surface plasmon resonance (SPR). The FGF-2 loading was quantified by the SPR in situ analysis. Our results showed that the (Alb/Hep)3cross-linking affected the amount of the bound heparin (from 150 to 315 ng/cm2), amount of FGF-2 loaded (from 75 to 125 ng/cm2), FGF-2 release (from 15 to 53% over 8 days), and consequently the HUVEC cell proliferation (from 50 to 80 × 103cells/cm2at day 5). All FGF-2 loaded assemblies stimulated the cell growth more than a soluble FGF-2 added into the cell media. In particular, the highest HUVECs proliferation was detected on the carbodiimide-cross-linked assembly.

The composition of these materials was identified by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Notably, the as-prepared hollow MoS2microflakes showed better electrocatalytic activity than other samples. The hollow flake-like structure can not only increase the active edge sites owing to the large specific surface area, but also enhance the electron transport to improve the electrocatalytic activity.

The initial structure consisting of totally 30 alternate AlN (8 nm thick) and TiN (9.3 nm thick) layers was deposited on Si (100) wafers, by reactive sputtering. Irradiation was done with 180 keV Ar+to a high dose of 8 × 1016ions/cm2, which introduces up to ∼10 at.% of argon species, and generates a maximum displacement per atom of 92 for AlN and 127 for TiN, around the projected ion range (109 ± 34 nm). Characterizations were performed by Rutherford backscattering spectrometry, spatially resolved x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. The obtained results reveal that this highly immiscible and thermally stable system suffered a severe modification upon the applied ion irradiation, although it was performed at room temperature. They illustrate a thorough inter-layer mixing, atomic redistribution, structural change and phase transformation within the affected depth. The original TiN layers appear to grow in thickness, consuming the adjacent AlN layers, while retaining the fcc crystalline structure. In the mostly affected region, the interaction proceeds until all of the original AlN layers are consumed. Compositional studies with photoemission spectroscopy show that due to the ion irradiation treatment the TiN and AlN layers are transformed into Ti0.75Al0.25N and Ti0.65Al0.35N ternary compounds characterized by a better homogenized chemical form compared to non-irradiated layers. The results can be interesting towards further development of radiation tolerant materials based on immiscible ceramic nanocomposites. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","29","X ray photoelectron spectroscopy","Aluminum - Argon - Chemical compounds - Crystal atomic structure - High resolution transmission electron microscopy - Ion beams - Ion bombardment - Ions - Irradiation - Mixing - Multilayers - Nanocomposites - Phase transitions - Photoelectron spectroscopy - Radiation - Reactive sputtering - Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy - Silicon wafers - Titanium - Titanium compounds - Titanium nitride - Transmission electron microscopy","Argon ion irradiation - Ceramic nanocomposites - Compositional studies - Interlayer - Radiation tolerant - Rutherford back-scattering spectrometry - SPEM - Structural modifications","541.1 AluminumAluminum - 542.3 Titanium and AlloysTitanium and Alloys - 633 Vacuum TechnologyVacuum Technology - 714.2 Semiconductor Devices and Integrated CircuitsSemiconductor Devices and Integrated Circuits - 741.3 Optical Devices and SystemsOptical Devices and Systems - 761 NanotechnologyNanotechnology - 801.4 Physical ChemistryPhysical Chemistry - 802.3 Chemical OperationsChemical Operations - 804 Chemical Products GenerallyChemical Products Generally - 804.2 Inorganic CompoundsInorganic Compounds - 932.1 High Energy PhysicsHigh Energy Physics - 933 Solid State PhysicsSolid State Physics - 933.1.1 Crystal LatticeCrystal Lattice","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The lateral force at uncovered step is larger than covered step due to the bending of step edge. The lateral force at monolayer uncovered step edge of h-BN is lower than graphene because h-BN possesses higher interlayer bonding strength than graphene and the bending of h-BN step edge is suppressed to some extent. The high uncovered step exhibits much larger lateral force than low uncovered step, which could be mainly induced by increased bending stiffness of step edge rather than increased step height.

Water-soluble XG persisted in the films following regeneration in water, indicating an attractive interaction between the CE and XG. The final CE:XG ratio of the blends was close to the initial value in solutions, further suggesting that intimate mixing takes place between CE and XG. The resulting CE/XG films were found to be free of ionic liquid, transparent and with no evidence of phase separation at the micron scale. The mechanical properties of the blend with a CE:XG ratio close to one revealed a synergistic effect for which a maximum in the elongation and stress at break was observed in combination with a high elastic modulus.

In addition to ASR expansion, the changes in sample weight, compressive strength, pore structure, and pore solution chemistry are also investigated for better understanding the factors controlling the ASR in AAS mortars.

The SEM/EDX results show no significant difference in both morphology and chemical composition of the ASR products. The lower ASR expansion at higher alkali dosage may be attributed to the relatively higher concentration of aluminum in the pore solution due to higher degree of slag hydration, which is expected to mitigate the dissolution of silica from the reactive aggregate. © 2017","38","Compressive strength","Alkalinity - Atomic absorption spectrometry - Caustic soda - Expansion - Mortar - Pore structure - Silica - Slags - Sodium","Alkali activated slags - Alkali activators - Alkali-silica reaction - Chemical compositions - Durability factor - Pore solution alkalinities - Pore solution chemistry - Reactive aggregate","414.3 Mortar (Before 1993, use code 412)Mortar (Before 1993, use code 412) - 549.1 Alkali MetalsAlkali Metals - 741.3 Optical Devices and SystemsOptical Devices and Systems - 801.1 Chemistry, GeneralChemistry, General - 804.2 Inorganic CompoundsInorganic Compounds - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and SolidsPhysical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids - 951 Materials ScienceMaterials Science","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

A three-particle correlation function is introduced to characterize the relative positions of various three particles—the so-called triplets.

It was found that in the case of liquid aluminium with temperatures 1000  K, 1500  K, and 2000  K the three-particle correlations are more pronounced within the spatial scales, comparable with a size of the second coordination sphere. In the case of amorphous aluminium with temperatures 50  K, 100  K, and 150  K these correlations in the mutual arrangement of three particles are manifested up to spatial scales, which are comparable with a size of the third coordination sphere. Temporal evolution of three-particle correlations is analyzed by using a time-dependent three-particle correlation function, for which an integro-differential equation of type of the generalized Langevin equation is output with help of projection operators technique.

Therefore, its spread in the food products has to be restricted. Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of a novel electrochemical biosensor based on gold microelectrodes modified with a new structure of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) coated with poly(pyrrole-co-pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid) (Py/Py-COOH) for high efficient detection of SPy. This analyte was quantified through a competitive detection procedure with 5-[4-(amino)phenylsulfonamide]-5-oxopentanoic acid-BSA (SA2-BSA) antigens toward polyclonal antibody (Ab-155). Initially, gold working electrodes (WEs) of integrated biomicro electro-mechanical system (BioMEMS) were functionalized by Ppy-COOH/MNPs, using a chronoamperometric (CA) electrodeposition. Afterward, SA2-BSA was covalently bonded to Py/Py-COOH/MNP modified gold WEs through amide bonding. The competitive detection of the analyte was made by a mixture of a fixed concentration of Ab-155 and decreasing concentrations of SPy from 50 µg L−1to 2 ng L−1. Atomic Force Microscopy characterization was performed in order to ensure Ppy-COOH/MNPs electrodeposition on the microelectrode surfaces. Electrochemical measurements of SPy detection were carried out using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). This biosensor was found to be highly sensitive and specific for SPy, with a limit of detection of 0.4 ng L−1. This technique was exploited to detect SPy in honey samples by using the standard addition method. The measurements were highly reproducible for detection and interferences namely, sulfadiazine (SDz), sulfathiazole (STz) and sulfamerazine (SMz).

Inspired by the recent experiments that Cu(111) surface doped by a small number of Pd atoms can exhibit excellent catalytic performance toward the dissociation of H2molecule as well as the high selective hydrogenation of acetylene as compared with pure Cu and Pd metal alone at low-temperature, here we performed systematic first-principles calculations to investigate the corresponding reaction mechanism related to the acetylene hydrogenation processes on single atom alloys (SAAs) and monolayer Pd/Cu(111) (i.e.,1.00 ML Pd/Cu(111)) model catalysts in detail, and to explore the possible factors controlling the high selectivity on SAAs. Our results clearly demonstrate that the SAA catalyst has higher selectivity for the ethylene formation than that of 1.00 ML Pd/Cu(111), and lower activity for the acetylene conversion compared with that of 1.00 ML Pd/Cu(111). The relatively high selectivity on SAA is mainly due to the facile desorption of ethylene and moderate activity in the dissociation of molecular H2. The main factor which lowers the selectivity towards the ethylene formation on 1.00 ML Pd/Cu(111) is that this system has a higher capacity to promote the breaking of C[sbnd]H/C[sbnd]C bonds, which leads to the formation of carbonaceous deposits and polymers such as benzene, and thus reduces the selectivity for the ethylene formation. Meanwhile, it was found that the desorption energy of ethylene on these two surfaces was smaller than the energy barrier of further hydrogenation, which results in the absence of ethane on these two systems. Micro-kinetic model analysis provides a further valuable insight into the evidence for the key factors controlling the catalytic activity and selectivity towards the selective hydrogenation of acetylene. Our findings may help people to design a highly selective hydrogenation catalyst by controlling the balance between the H2dissociation and C[sbnd]H/C[sbnd]C bond broken processes, and a good catalyst should be the one with the modest catalytic activity in the activation of molecular H2. At the same time, the present work provides an extremely significant mechanism of acetylene trimerization to form benzene and carbon formation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","74","Catalyst selectivity","Acetylene - Atoms - Benzene - Calculations - Carbon - Catalyst activity - Catalysts - Design for testability - Desorption - Dissociation - Ethylene - Hydrogenation - Lighting - Low temperature engineering - Palladium - Temperature","1.00 ML Pd/Cu(111) - Acetylene hydrogenation - Carbonaceous deposits - First-principles calculation - Micro-kinetic analysis - Microkinetic modeling - Selective hydrogenation - Single atoms","547.1 Precious MetalsPrecious Metals - 641.1 ThermodynamicsThermodynamics - 802.2 Chemical ReactionsChemical Reactions - 802.3 Chemical OperationsChemical Operations - 804 Chemical Products GenerallyChemical Products Generally - 804.1 Organic CompoundsOrganic Compounds - 921 MathematicsMathematics - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular PhysicsAtomic and Molecular Physics","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

To avoid motion artifacts and simplify the procedure, a single-snapshot technique for mapping melanin, oxyhemoglobin, and deoxyhemoglobin of in-vivo skin by a smartphone under simultaneous three-wavelength (448-532-659 nm) laser illumination is proposed and examined. Three monochromatic spectral images related to the illumination wavelengths were extracted from the smartphone camera RGB image data set with respect to crosstalk between the RGB detection bands.

The initial period of release and deposition is characterised by high degrees of uncertainty, which is likely to lead to precautionary emergency measures being carried out regardless of the actual dangers to the public, and therefore it is excluded from the optimisation problem. Instead, the analysis is performed on the timescale of weeks, months, years and decades after the accident, implying that the problem is largely deterministic if one disregards long-term economic uncertainties. It is on these longer timescales that economically-driven decisions could be made on whether or not to implement various protection and recovery measures, which include relocation, remediation, repopulation and food banning. Our model allows one to find the joint cost-minimal strategy across the set of measures, providing certain spatial and temporal flexibilities are permitted. Several qualitatively different strategies are identified, including those with no relocation and delayed remediation. Which strategy is optimal depends on the initial radiation levels, the rates and costs of the individual actions, and the preferred economic valuation of the relevant health effects associated with radiation. Our main message is that in many possible settings relocation should be used sparingly and repopulation should be delayed to exploit natural decay of the radioactive elements. These findings could provide useful recommendations to regulators in civil nuclear industry and help devise better policies for implementing emergency response and recovery measures. © 2017 The Authors","77","Economic and social effects","Accidents - Artificial intelligence - Continuous time systems - Decision making - Decision support systems - Nuclear fuels - Nuclear industry - Nuclear power plants - Nuclear reactor accidents - Optimization - Public policy - Radiation effects - Radioactive elements - Radioactivity - Recovery - Uncertainty analysis","Decision making models - Economic uncertainty - Nuclear accidents - Nuclear emergencies - Optimisation problems - Optimisations - Radioactive release - Recovery strategies",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

We also construct the general analytical and singular solutions for members of this family of Liénard-type equations by virtue of the generalized Sundman transformations. To demonstrate applications of our results we consider several examples of the Liénard-type equations, with a generalization of the modified Emden equation among them, and construct their autonomous Lagrangians, Jacobi last multipliers and first integral as well as their general analytical solutions. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","32","Integral equations","Lagrange multipliers - Lithium","First integral - General analytical solution - Jacobi last multipliers - Lagrangian - Lagrangians - Singular solutions - Sundman transformations - Time independents","542.4 Lithium and AlloysLithium and Alloys - 921.2 CalculusCalculus","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The GO linking layer provides a remarkable analytical platform for bioaffinity binding interface due to its favorable combination of exceptionally high surface-to-volume ratio and excellent optical and biochemical properties. A new GO deposition technique based on chemical-bonding in conjunction with physical-adsorption was proposed to offer the advantages of a strong bonding between GO and fiber device surface and a homogeneous GO overlay with desirable stability, repeatability and durability. The surface morphology of GO overlay was characterized by Atomic force microscopy, Scanning electron microscope, and Raman spectroscopy. By depositing the GO with a thickness of 49.2 nm, the sensitivity in refractive index (RI) of dLPG was increased to 2538 nm/RIU, 200% that of non-coated dLPG, in low RI region (1.333–1.347) where bioassays and biological events were usually carried out. The IgG was covalently immobilized on GO-dLPG via EDC/NHS heterobifunctional cross-linking chemistry leaving the binding sites free for target analyte recognition. The performance of immunosensing was evaluated by monitoring the kinetic bioaffinity binding between IgG and specific anti-IgG in real-time. The GO-dLPG based biosensor demonstrates an ultrahigh sensitivity with limit of detection of 7 ng/mL, which is 10-fold better than non-coated dLPG biosensor and 100-fold greater than LPG-based immunosensor. Moreover, the reusability of GO-dLPG biosensor has been facilitated by a simple regeneration procedure based on stripping off bound anti-IgG treatment. The proposed ultrasensitive biosensor can be further adapted as biophotonic platform opening up the potential for food safety, environmental monitoring, clinical diagnostics and medical applications. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","60","Binding sites","Antibodies - Antigens - Atomic force microscopy - Bins - Biosensors - Chemical analysis - Chemical bonds - Chemical stability - Diagnosis - Fiber bonding - Fiber optic sensors - Graphene - Immunosensors - Medical applications - Optical fibers - Refractive index - Reusability - Scanning electron microscopy","Antibody-antigen - Environmental Monitoring - Graphene oxide nanosheet - Graphene oxides - High surface-to-volume ratio - Label free - Long Period Gratings - Ultra-high-sensitivity","461 Bioengineering and BiologyBioengineering and Biology - 694.4 StorageStorage - 741 Light, Optics and Optical DevicesLight, Optics and Optical Devices - 761 NanotechnologyNanotechnology - 801 ChemistryChemistry - 804 Chemical Products GenerallyChemical Products Generally","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Nanoparticle size is an important parameter that influences the stability, bioavailability and efficacy of the drug. In air-jet atomization technique, dry particle diameters are generally predicted by using solute diffusion models involving the key concept of critical supersaturation solubility ratio (Sc) that dictates the point of crust formation within the droplet. As no reliable method exists to determine this quantity, the present study proposes an aerosol based method to determine Sc for a given solute-solvent system and process conditions. The feasibility has been demonstrated by conducting experiments for stearic acid in ethanol and chloroform as well as for anti-tubercular drug isoniazid in ethanol. Sc values were estimated by combining the experimentally observed particle and droplet diameters with simulations from a solute diffusion model. Important findings of the study were: (i) the measured droplet diameters systematically decreased with increasing precursor concentration (ii) estimated Sc values were 9.3 ± 0.7, 13.3 ± 2.4 and 18 ± 0.8 for stearic acid in chloroform, stearic acid and isoniazid in ethanol respectively (iii) experimental results pointed at the correct interfacial tension pre-factor to be used in theoretical estimates of Sc and (iv) results showed a consistent evidence for the existence of induction time delay between the attainment of theoretical Sc and crust formation. The proposed approach has been validated by testing its predictive power for a challenge concentration against experimental data. The study not only advances spray-drying technique by establishing an aerosol based approach to determine Sc, but also throws considerable light on the interfacial processes responsible for solid-phase formation in a rapidly supersaturating system. Until satisfactory theoretical formulae for predicting CSS are developed, the present approach appears to offer the best option for engineering nanoparticle size through solute diffusion models. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","47","Fighter aircraft","Aerosols - Atomization - Biochemistry - Chlorine compounds - Controlled drug delivery - Diffusion - Diffusion in solids - Drops - Ethanol - Hydrazine - Jets - Nanoparticles - Solubility - Stearic acid - Supersaturation - Surface tension - Time delay","Concentration dependence - Droplet diameters - Droplet evaporation - Equilibrium solubilities - Induction time - Solute diffusion","631.1 Fluid Flow, GeneralFluid Flow, General - 652.1.2 Military AircraftMilitary Aircraft - 713 Electronic CircuitsElectronic Circuits - 761 NanotechnologyNanotechnology - 801.2 BiochemistryBiochemistry - 801.4 Physical ChemistryPhysical Chemistry - 802.3 Chemical OperationsChemical Operations - 804.1 Organic CompoundsOrganic Compounds - 804.2 Inorganic CompoundsInorganic Compounds - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and SolidsPhysical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids - 933 Solid State PhysicsSolid State Physics","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Historically, heavy metal contamination at the Savannah River Site (SRS) in South Carolina has resulted from accidental releases of stored waste generated from nuclear weapon production in the early 1950s. Songbirds inhabiting and using resources from these areas have the potential to bioaccumulate metals but there is limited information on metal concentration levels in areas suspected of contamination as well as uncontaminated sites. Nonlethal tissues samples from avian blood and feathers provide a reliable approach for determining the bioavailability of these pollutants (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb, Se, and Zn). The objectives of this study were to survey terrestrial heavy metal contamination at the SRS on potentially bioavailable contaminated (PBC) sites through blood and feather samples from resident Northern Cardinals (Cardinalis cardinalis) and migratory Great Crested Flycatchers (Myiarchus crinitus) and quantify sex-specific concentrations within species. Samples were collected in April to June of 2016. Cardinals had lower blood concentrations of Hg (β = − 0.17, 85% CL = − 0.26, − 0.09) and Se (β = − 0.33, 85% CL = − 0.50, − 0.16) than flycatchers. Cr feather concentrations were less in cardinals (β = − 1.46, 85% CL = − 2.44, − 0.49) and all feathers of both species from reference locations had significantly less Zn (β = − 67.92, 85% CL = − 128.71, − 7.14). Results indicate flycatchers were exposed to differing heavy metal levels during feather formation on their wintering grounds as compared to their recent exposure (through bloods samples) on their breeding grounds. Sex of individuals did not have a significant impact on bioaccumulation in either species. Overall, metal concentration levels in both species indicate minimal risk for acute toxicity; however, there is limited research on wild passerine populations with similar concentration levels. Therefore, further research on reproductive success of these birds should be explored. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","67","River pollution","Accidents - Bioaccumulation - Biochemistry - Biomarkers - Blood - Contamination - Heavy metals - Land reclamation - Lead - Nuclear weapons - Zinc","Anthropogenic activity - Bioaccumulate - Heavy metal contamination - Migratory - Nonlethal - Passerine - Specific concentration - Surrounding environment","404 Civil Defense and Military EngineeringCivil Defense and Military Engineering - 442.2 Land ReclamationLand Reclamation - 453 Water PollutionWater Pollution - 461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue EngineeringBiological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 461.9 BiologyBiology - 531 Metallurgy and MetallographyMetallurgy and Metallography - 546.1 Lead and AlloysLead and Alloys - 546.3 Zinc and AlloysZinc and Alloys - 801.2 BiochemistryBiochemistry - 914.1 Accidents and Accident PreventionAccidents and Accident Prevention","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The carbon emissions decomposition illustrated that the scale of production factor played a major role in the growth of Tianjin industrial carbon emissions and the average contribution of carbon emissions is up to 220.8975% in the statistical period; the intensity of energy factor played an important role in slowing down the growth of industrial carbon dioxide emissions. The average contribution of carbon emissions was −136.1994% in the statistical period. The prediction model based on carbon emissions data from industrial energy consumption from 2003 to 2012 reached a high accuracy, with an average error of 1.78% for stochastic impacts by regression on population, affluence, and technology (STIRPAT) model, 2.41% for the Logistic regression model and an average error of 1.54% for the grey model.

The protein fluorescence quenching method and ITC studies confirmed the complex formation. The degree of protein fluorescence quenching increased from chlorine to iodine boron derivatives that is attributed to external heavy atom effect. The ITC data point on the existence in the protein structure of two types of binding sites: with higher and lower affinity to closo-borates. Albumin-closo-borate complex binding ratio, n (4–5 anions per protein molecule) is higher than for the parent hydrogen closo-borates (2 anions per protein molecule). Binding constants estimated by fluorescent and ITC methods indicate higher affinity of halogen closo-borates to albumins (K in the range of 104–106 M−1) comparing to that of the hydrogen closo-borate (K about 103 M−1).

H2O)(LTFAW), consisting of zwitterion tryptophan molecule in conjunction with a fumaric acid molecule and a water molecule was grown by slow solvent evaporation technique from aqueous solution. The organic chromophore crystallizes from water in its zwitterions exhibiting tabular habit in monoclinic system with acentric space group C2 (Z = 4). The sharp peaks observed in Powder X-ray diffractogram depicts the crystalline nature. The presence of functional groups in the grown crystal was analyzed using FT-IR spectrum. The carbon and hydrogen environment in molecular structure was investigated using FT-NMR technique using deuterated DMSO solution. Ultraviolet–visible spectral analysis reveal that the crystal possess lower cut-off wavelength down to 275 nm, is a key factor to exhibit Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) signal. The direct optical band gap is evaluated to be 5.28 eV from the UV absorption profile. The evaluation of optical constants by employing UV–visible absorbance data such as, extinction coefficient, reflectance, refractive index, optical conductivity are supportive towards good performance as NLO devices. Temperature of decomposition was investigated using thermogravimetric analysis/differential thermal analysis techniques (TG/DTA). The luminescence profile exhibited two peaks (362 nm, 683 nm) due to the donation of protons from carboxylic group to amino group. The nonlinear optical behavior from the noncentrosymmetric crystal was observed by the generation of frequency doubled (2ω) optical radiation when subjected to pulsed Nd:YAG laser (1064 nm, 10 ns, 10 Hz) using Kurtz-Perry method. The variation of dielectric constant (Ε) and dielectric loss (Ε) vs. Log f for the title compound was analysed at a few selected temperatures and frequencies. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","34","Harmonic generation","Activation energy - Amino acids - Carbon - Chromophores - Dielectric losses - Energy gap - Molecules - Nanocrystalline materials - Neodymium lasers - Nonlinear analysis - Nonlinear optics - Nuclear magnetic resonance - Optical conductivity - Optical frequency conversion - Optical materials - Organic lasers - Photoluminescence - Pulsed lasers - Refractive index - Solutions - Spectrum analysis - Stereochemistry - Thermoanalysis - Thermodynamic stability - Thermogravimetric analysis - X ray diffraction","Extinction coefficients - Non-centrosymmetric crystals - Non-linear optical material - Nonlinear optical behavior - Nonlinear optical crystal - Optical absorbance - Solvent evaporation techniques - Thermal analysis techniques","641.1 ThermodynamicsThermodynamics - 708.1 Dielectric MaterialsDielectric Materials - 741 Light, Optics and Optical DevicesLight, Optics and Optical Devices - 744.1 Lasers, GeneralLasers, General - 744.4 Solid State LasersSolid State Lasers - 761 NanotechnologyNanotechnology - 801 ChemistryChemistry - 804 Chemical Products GenerallyChemical Products Generally - 804.1 Organic CompoundsOrganic Compounds - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and SolidsPhysical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular PhysicsAtomic and Molecular Physics","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The synthesized molecules were well characterized using spectroscopic techniques like UV–Vis, fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (1H &13C) spectroscopy. The compounds were crystalized and their final structures were confirmed after diffracting these on single crystal X-ray diffractometer. The spectroscopic and molecular information were compared with simulated properties calculated via density functional theory (DFT). Geometries of all chalcone compounds have been optimized by density functional theory (DFT) at B3LYP level with 6-311 + G(d,p) basis set combination. Theoretical investigations about UV–Vis and FT-IR spectra of chalcone derivatives were reported using time dependent TD/DFT/B3LYP/6-311 + G(d,p) and B3LYP/6-311 + G(d,p) level respectively. The current study revealed that the theoretical findings complement the experimental results. Nonlinear optical properties of chalcone systems were calculated to gain insights the possibility of designing these compounds as NLO materials. The findings suggested that the first order hyperpolarizability of all the molecules except 1-(4-bromophenyl)-3-(1-methyl-1H-pyrrol-3-yl)prop-2-en-1-oneis also greater than the value of urea (β = 0.372 × 10−30 esu).

These compounds show two central five carbon atom rings, fused in such a way to define a central bicyclo[3.3.0]octa-2,6-diene core. The carbon atoms which fuse both rings have sp3hybridization, then they are not coplanar. A dihedral angle of about 63° corresponds to butterfly conformation. UV–Vis spectra of I and II measured in solution show symmetrical bands centred around 245 nm (Ε ∼ 104 M−1cm−1). These bands are consistent with π→π* transitions. TD-DFT simulated spectra over the DFT optimized in gas phase confirms this hypothesis, and additionally suggest a non-negligible contribution of n→π* transition for II. The slight dependence of λmaxon solvent polarity experimentally observed for II is consistent with some nπ* character. After excitation at 250 nm, a weak emission around 400 nm was detected for both compounds, with quantum yield values below detection limit for I. The value of λemof II was observed to be sensible to the solvent polarity, confirming some relevant n→π* character. The almost fully quenching of the emission of I in solution would be attributed to a rather strong intramolecular hydrogen bond established between the hydroxyl group and the oxo-oxygen atom from tert-butoxy group, which is observed in the crystal structure of the compound (OO ranges from 2.635(2) Å to 2.672(2) Å).

However, only Co atoms located in the edges of MoS2can create CoMoS phase, so it is a challenge to obtain CoMoS phase with homogeneous distribution limited by the layered MoS2and doping method of Co. Herein, we reported a simple one-pot hydrothermal method to prepare novel ternary CoS2/MoS2/RGO with CoMoS phase for HER using reduced graphene oxide (RGO) as support. XPS proves the formation of CoMoS phase, implying the enhanced activity for HER. RGO support ensures the well distribution of CoMoS phase and enhances the conductivity of CoS2/MoS2/RGO. Compared to CoS2/RGO, MoS2/RGO and CoS2/MoS2, the obtained CoS2/MoS2/RGO shows superior activity for HER with an onset overpotential of −80 mV (vs. RHE), small Tafel slope of 56 mV dec−1, high exchange current density of 11.4 μA cm−2and rigid electrochemical durability. The enhanced performances for HER may be ascribed to the formation of CoMoS phase with high activity and the existence of RGO support with good electrical conductivitys in ternary CoS2/MoS2/RGO. Therefore, the introduction of CoMoS phase and RGO into MoS2could effectively enhance electrocatalytic properties for HER. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","44","Transition metal compounds","Electrocatalysts - Graphene - Molybdenum compounds","CoMoS phase - Electrocatalytic properties - Exchange current densities - Homogeneous distribution - Hydrogen evolution reactions - Hydrothermal methods - Reduced graphene oxides - Reduced graphene oxides (RGO)","761 NanotechnologyNanotechnology - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial ChemicalsChemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 804 Chemical Products GenerallyChemical Products Generally","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Samples were characterized by means of TG, XRD, N2adsorption–desorption, pyridine-IR, nitrobenzene-IR, chloroform-IR, and CO2-TPD. Pyridine-DRIFTS measurements evidence two kinds of acid sites in all the samples. Nitrobenzene, chloroform-DRIFTS, and CO2-TPD reveal that there are large amounts of medium-strength base sites on all the metal oxides, and only CaO, ZnO, and γ-Al2O3have strong base sites. And the benzaldehyde selectivity was increased in the same order of the alkalinity of the metal oxides. With weaker sites, ozone molecules form coordinative complexes bound via the terminal oxygen atom, observed by vibrational frequencies at 2095–2122 and 1026–1054 cm−1. The formation of ozonide O3−at 790 cm−1, atomic oxygen at 1317 cm−1, and superoxide O2−at 1124 cm−1was detected; these species are believed to be intermediates of O3decomposition on strong acid/base sites. The adsorption of ozone on metal oxides is a weak adsorption, and other gases, such as CO2, will compete with O3adsorption.

In this paper, we derive a time fractional neutron point kinetics equations (FNPK) model considering a new term for the time derivative of the reactivity. Fractional Leibenz rule is used for such derivation. The effect resulting from the additional term of the reactivity derivative is discussed. It has been found that without this additional term, the modified model will be compliant with the earlier published models for the FNPK. The proposed model of FNPK describes infinite and finite bar reactor cores according to the nonleakage probability and the geometric buckling values. We have applied an effective implicit difference approximation to solve the modified model for finite cylindrical reactor core for both average one group and six groups of delayed neutron precursors.

Altered levels of homocysteine, cysteine, methionine, and glutamic acid have been observed in plasma of ALS patients. In this context, a method for determination of these potential biomarkers in plasma by capillary electrophoresis tandem mass spectrometry (CE-MS/MS) is proposed herein. Sample preparation was carefully investigated, since sulfur-containing amino acids may interact with plasma proteins. Owing to the non-thiol sulfur atom in methionine, it was necessary to split sample preparation into two methods: i) determination of homocysteine and cysteine as S-acetyl amino acids; ii) determination of glutamic acid and methionine. All amino acids were separated within 25 min by CE-MS/MS using 5 mol L−1acetic acid as background electrolyte and 5 mmol L−1acetic acid in 50% methanol/H2O (v/v) as sheath liquid. The proposed CE-MS/MS method was validated, presenting RSD values below 6% and 11% for intra- and inter-day precision, respectively, for the middle concentration level within the linear range. The limits of detection ranged from 35 (homocysteine) to 268 nmol L−1(glutamic acid).

While many efforts have focused on experimental determination and modeling of liquid water content in inorganic-salt rich soils, additional factors that govern liquid water formation remain largely unexplored. The purpose of this study is to determine main soil properties that will affect unfrozen water content. We analyzed liquid water content and bulk freezing points using high field deuterium NMR measurements and compared the results to the amount of liquid water content at the same temperatures based on salt concentration and composition using an empirical chemical equilibrium model (FREZCHEM). We selected soils with a wide range of salt concentrations and composition collected from the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica. The comparison indicates that at 50% unfrozen water content the freezing temperatures deviate substantially from water content modeled based on salt composition. In particular, the NMR freezing points are lower than those calculated with FREZCHEM for all low to medium salt content samples. The results indicate that soil properties other than aqueous chemical composition add to liquid water content. Particle size does not necessarily correlate with the liquid water content, revealing that more detailed investigation including surface area and composition may be necessary to describe the dependence of unfrozen water content on soil properties. The study highlights the necessity of experimental measurements of water content due to effects of multiple factors that are difficult to take into account in simulations. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","67","Frozen soils","Chemical analysis - Freezing - Grain size and shape - Liquids - Models - Nuclear magnetic resonance - Particle size - Soils - Water content","Antarctic soils - Chemical compositions - Chemical equilibrium modeling - Experimental determination - Freezing curves - FREZCHEM - Grain size - Unfrozen water contents","483.1 Soils and Soil MechanicsSoils and Soil Mechanics","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Experiments SANS was used to characterize the size and shape of micelles present prior to and during the in vitro simulated intestinal digestion of a model food-associated lipid, triolein. Findings Pre-lipolysis mixtures of a bile salt and phospholipid simulating bile concentrations in fed conditions were organized in micelles with an average volume of 40 nm3. During lipolysis, the micelle volume increased 2.5-fold over a 2-h digestion period due to growth in one direction as a result of insertion of monoglycerides and fatty acids.

Herein, a novel analytical method for iAs in algae was reported, using bromine halogenation and on-line nonpolar solid phase extraction (SPE) followed by hydride generation atomic fluorescence spectrometry (HG-AFS). The separation of iAs from algae was first performed by nonpolar SPE sorbent using Br-for arsenic halogenation. Algae samples were extracted with 1% perchloric acid. Then, 1.5 mL extract was reduced by 1% thiourea, and simultaneously reacted (for 30 min) with 50 μL of 10% KBr for converting iAs to AsBr3after adding 3.5 mL of 70% HCl to 5 mL. A polystyrene (PS) resin cartridge was employed to retain arsenicals, which were hydrolyzed, eluted from the PS resin with H2O, and categorized as iAs. The total iAs was quantified by HG-AFS. Under optimum conditions, the spiked recoveries of iAs in real algae samples were in the 82–96% range, and the method achieved a desirable limit of detection of 3 μg kg−1. The inter-day relative standard deviations were 4.5% and 4.1% for spiked 100 and 500 μg kg−1respectively, which proved acceptable for this method. For real algae samples analysis, the highest presence of iAs was found in sargassum fusiforme, followed by kelp, seaweed and laver. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","40","Extraction","Algae - Arsenic - Bromine - Fluorescence - Fluorescence spectroscopy - Halogenation - Hydrides - Phase separation - Polystyrenes - Resins - Spectrometry","Hydride generation-atomic fluorescence spectrometry - Inorganic arsenic - Limit of detection - Optimum conditions - Polystyrene resins - Relative standard deviations - Sargassum fusiforme - SPE-HG-AFS","741.1 Light/OpticsLight/Optics - 802.2 Chemical ReactionsChemical Reactions - 802.3 Chemical OperationsChemical Operations - 804 Chemical Products GenerallyChemical Products Generally - 804.2 Inorganic CompoundsInorganic Compounds - 815.1.1 Organic PolymersOrganic Polymers - 941.4 Optical Variables MeasurementsOptical Variables Measurements","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Group-wise neutronic coupling coefficients between the core regions are calculated applying the associated fundamental and first mode eigenvalue separation values. The resultant nonlinear state space representation of the core behavior is quite suitable for evaluation of reactivity induced power transients such as load following operation. The model however comprises a multi-physics coupling of sub-systems with extremely distant relaxation times whose stiffness treatment inquire costly multistep implicit numerical methods. An adiabatic treatment of the sluggish poison dynamics is therefore proposed as a way out. The approach helps further investigate the nonlinear system within a linear time varying (LTV) framework whereby a semi-analytical framework is established. This scheme incorporates a matrix exponential analytical solution of the perturbed system as a quite efficient tool to study load following operation and control purposes. Poison dynamics are updated within larger intervals which exclude the need for specific numerical schemes of stiff systems. Simulation results of the axial offset conducted on a VVER-1000 reactor at the beginning (BOC) and the end of cycle (EOC) display quite acceptable results compared with available benchmarks.

For the enhanced supercapacitive performances, insulator silver chloride nanoparticles (AgCl NPs) were intercalated into the interlayer gap of rGO.

As a result, (iii) the specific capacitance was improved in accordance with the enlarged specific surface area of rGO. Furthermore, (iv) the well-developed rGO edges, which were opened by the AgCl intercalation, enabled formation of more bonds between PANi and rGO by selective grafting of PANi to the rGO edges. Hence, the bonds of PANi–rGO, as conducting paths, substantially reduced the total electrical resistance.

The aim of the present study is to synthesize a soluble poly (methacrylic acid-niclosamide) polymer (PMAN) and study the effects of PMAN on arterial function in vitro and the blood pressure and heart rate of rats in vivo. We synthesized the poly (methacrylic acid-niclosamide) polymer (PMAN), the chemical structure of which was identified by FTIR and1H NMR spectra. The average molecular weight and polydispersity index of PMAN were 5138 and 1.193 respectively. Compared with niclosamide, the water solubility of niclosamide in PMAN was significantly increased. PMAN showed dose-dependent vasorelaxation effect on rat mesenteric arteries with intact or denuded endothelium in phenylephrine (PE) and high K+(KPSS)-induced vasoconstriction models in vitro. The efficacy of vasorelaxant effect and the cytotoxic effect of PMAN on vascular smooth muscle cells (A10) were lower than that of niclosamide. The LD50of PMAN in mice (iv) was 80 mg/kg. Venous injection of PMAN (equivalent 5 mg niclosamide per kg) showed acute reduction of the rat blood pressure and heart rate in vivo. In conclusion, the solubility of niclosamide was increased in the way of poly (methacrylic acid-niclosamide) polymer, which relaxes the constricted arteries in vitro and reduces the rat blood pressure and heart rate in vivo, indicating that modifying niclosamide solubility through polymerization is a feasible approach to improve its pharmacokinetic profiles for potential clinic application. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","15","Solubility","Biochemistry - Blood pressure - Cytotoxicity - Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy - Heart - Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy - Polymers - Rats","Average molecular weight - Niclosamide - Pharmacokinetic profiles - Polydispersity indices - Synthesis and characterizations - Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells - Vasoconstriction - Vasorelaxation","461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue EngineeringBiological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 461.9 BiologyBiology - 801 ChemistryChemistry - 815.1 Polymeric MaterialsPolymeric Materials","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Furthermore, our analysis shows that the interaction between the nanoparticles and the graphene is rather local, i.e., only the nanoparticle atoms close to the contact region are involved in the interaction, being the electronic contact region much higher for defective-graphene than for pristine-graphene.

Other important results are that (1) global parameters such as effective multiplication factors may be considered but only marginally in the adjustment and (2) only the adjustment of those cross-sections resulting independent of the PIA sequence may be considered as a basis for reliable adjustments, provided that nonlinearity is accounted for. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","10","Iterative methods","Least squares approximations","Effective multiplication factor - Fast spectrum - Global parameters - Linear least squares - Nuclear data - Reliable or unreliable adjustment - Sensitivity coefficient - Variance/covariance","921.6 Numerical MethodsNumerical Methods","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

An accurate value for the Henry's law constant for hydrogen is needed if the use of these equations is to be meaningful. The purpose of this study is to develop an empirical correlation for determining the Henry's law constant for application to nuclear reactors. The effects of temperature and pressure on the Henry's law constant are investigated using simulated PWR primary-water conditions. The Henry's law constant was calculated by an in-situ measurement of the partial pressure of hydrogen using a hydrogen sensor based on a Pd–Ag alloy tube. At 20 MPa, the Henry's law constant decreased by ∼40% as the temperature increased from 290 to 330 °C. The Henry's law constant increased by an average of 9% as the pressure increased from 13.8 to 20 MPa at each temperature. Thus, it depends more strongly on the temperature than on the pressure. Based on the experimental data, an empirical correlation for predicting the Henry's law constant was developed using a linear regression method, which was validated by comparing with results in the literature. The deviation between the Henry's law constant obtained using our model and that reported in the literature was in the range of 0.5%–10%. The hydrogen fugacity estimated using our model was within 10% of that found in the literature. Thus, the proposed empirical model appears to be more accurate than previously published models. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","20","Pressurized water reactors","Hydrogen - Linear regression - Nuclear reactors - Regression analysis - Temperature","Effects of temperature - Empirical correlations - Henry's Law constant - Hydrogen concentration - In-situ measurement - Linear regression methods - PWSCC - Temperature and pressures","641.1 ThermodynamicsThermodynamics - 804 Chemical Products GenerallyChemical Products Generally - 922.2 Mathematical StatisticsMathematical Statistics","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In the present study, we have designed a selective and sensitive method for the determination of ultratrace contents of Pb2 +in biological samples, based on the guanine (G)-quadruplex formed by the aptamer with hairpin structure and Pb2 +. For this purpose, Pb2 +specific aptamer serving as affinity probe to capture and separate trace amounts of the analyte, was covalently linked to Fe3O4/graphene oxide (GO) surface by using a suitable cross-linking agent. Then, the G-quadruplex complex was formed by the opening of the “neck- ring” of the hairpin structure of aptamer in the presence of Pb2 +. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was used for determination of Pb2 +in biological matrices.

The resulted CMCs were further converted into cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) with high crystallinity by acidic hydrolysis. The physicochemical characteristics and morphological feature of CMCs and CNCs were studied by various analytical techniques such as UV–vis spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), Scanning electron microscope (SEM), Fluorescence spectroscopy, Atomic force microscopy (AFM), High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD).

Hexadecylamine was used as an extractor for MnO2particles in the bottom-up extraction to the 1-butanol phase and top-down extraction to the dichloromethane phase. The reduction of particle agglomeration facilitated the fabrication of MnO2-carbon nanotube composite electrodes for electrochemical supercapacitors with enhanced mixing of the individual components and active mass as high as 35 mg cm−2. Electrochemical testing results showed superior performance of the composite MnO2-carbon nanotube electrodes, prepared by the bottom-up strategy. The new strategies allowed the fabrication of advanced electrodes, which showed a capacitance of 5.48 F cm−2at a scan rate of 2 mV s−1, good capacitance retention at high scan rates and low resistance. In another conceptually new bottom-up strategy colloidal titania particles were modified during synthesis with 2,3,4-trihydroxybenzaldehyde, which allowed strong catecholate-type bonding to the Ti atoms on the particle surface.

A combination of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Potentiodynamic polarization (PD), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and wire beam electrode (WBE) techniques was found to be useful in the characterization of this system.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used for investigation of the fracture morphology and phase transformations taking place during friction welding process. Chemical compositions of the interfaces of the welded joints were determined by using energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). Effects of friction time (FT) and friction pressure (FP) on the ultimate tensile strength (UTS) were studied by plotting graphs. The maximum average strength of 234 MPa, which is 84.78% of the aluminium alloy base material, is achieved at a friction time of 3.5 s and friction pressure of 40 MPa, respectively. The UTS of joints increases with increasing of FP and FT and then decreases after reaching the maximum value, with increase of friction load and time. Microstructure of friction welds consisted of fine equiaxed grains (formed due to dynamic recrystallization) and coarse grains in the periphery region on AA side. A plastic deformation in the direction of burrs is visible mainly on AA side. EDS-SEM scan line analyses across the interface have not confirmed the diffusion of tungsten and nickel to AA side. The nature of the friction welding joints is rather adhesive than diffusive. The EDS point spectrometry showed some enrichment of Ni-Fe matrix with Al atoms close to the joint. Absence of intermetallic phases was found in the weld interface on SEM level observation. The fracture procedes mainly through the cleavage planes at the interface. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","45","Aluminum alloys","Aluminum - Crystal microstructure - Dynamic recrystallization - Energy dispersive spectroscopy - Fracture - Friction - Friction welding - Intermetallics - Microstructure - Nickel - Scanning electron microscopy - Tensile strength - Transmission electron microscopy - Tribology - Tungsten - Tungsten alloys - Welding - Welds","Chemical compositions - Energy dispersive spectroscopies (EDS) - Fine equiaxed grains - Fracture morphology - Intermetallic phasis - Properties and microstructures - Tungsten heavy alloys - Ultimate tensile strength","531.1 MetallurgyMetallurgy - 538.2 WeldingWelding - 538.2.1 Welding ProcessesWelding Processes - 541.1 AluminumAluminum - 541.2 Aluminum AlloysAluminum Alloys - 543.5 Tungsten and AlloysTungsten and Alloys - 548.1 NickelNickel - 931 Classical Physics; Quantum Theory; RelativityClassical Physics; Quantum Theory; Relativity - 933.1.1 Crystal LatticeCrystal Lattice - 951 Materials ScienceMaterials Science","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

AuNPs and protein A are used to increase the surface coverage of Immunoglobulin G (IgG) and promote the oriented immobilization of the antibodies on the immunosensing interface. The modified gold surfaces with biomolecules were thoroughly characterized by a combination of techniques: UV–vis spectrophotometry, conventional ellipsometry and atomic force microscopy. The immunosensor performance was assessed in real-time, by surface plasmon resonance and by the highly sensitive total internal reflection imaging ellipsometry, through the specific biorecognition between anti-IgG and the immobilized IgG molecules. We demonstrate that the presence of AuNPs improves the sensitivity of the anti-IgG specific detection, whereas the presence of co-adsorbed CS2is responsible for blocking the undesired protein nonspecific adsorption to the gold substrate.

Applications of bio-binder in enhancing asphalt's properties have gained profound progresses in past several years. However, limitation still exists in our knowledge on adhesion property of asphalt blended with bio-binder. This study aims to characterize adhesion behavior of bio-binder modified asphalt using sessile drop device (SDD) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Relationship between the two test results is also investigated. It is shown that addition of bio-binder would introduce different impacts on surface properties for different base asphalts (Pen30 and Pen70 asphalts in this paper), which may be attributed to distinct compatibilities between bio-binder and different asphalts. And the work of adhesion data demonstrates that the bio-binder enhances the interaction between basalt and bio-binder modified Pen70 asphalt binders while depress the interaction between basalt and bio-binder modified Pen30 asphalt binders. It is also found that AFM adhesive force is tip-dependent which may be interpreted using different contact mechanics. In this paper, the high coefficient of variation in soft tip's data may result from the capillary force and contamination during scanning. Interestingly, dispersive surface free energy and AFM results show some reasonable agreements for modified Pen70 asphalts, though there is still a gap between these two methods' results. It is speculated that the variations between surface free energy method and AFM measurement can be attributed to the differences in probe substance, test scale and measured components. Findings in this paper not only promote the development of bio-binder modified asphalt, but also shed lights of the application of AFM in characterization of asphalt's adhesion property. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","23","Binders","Adhesion - Asphalt - Atomic force microscopy - Basalt - Bins - Deformation - Drops - Free energy","Adhesion behaviors - Adhesion properties - Coefficient of variation - Contact Mechanics - Dispersive surface free energies - Renewable materials - Sessile drops - Surface free energy","411.1 AsphaltAsphalt - 641.1 ThermodynamicsThermodynamics - 694.4 StorageStorage - 741.3 Optical Devices and SystemsOptical Devices and Systems - 803 Chemical Agents and Basic Industrial ChemicalsChemical Agents and Basic Industrial Chemicals - 951 Materials ScienceMaterials Science","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The enhanced performance obtained from the bi-layer channel AZO/ZnO TFT devices is explained by the inserted AZO front channel layer playing the role of the mobility booster. © 2017, The Author(s).","29","Atomic layer deposition","Deposition - Leakage currents - Semiconducting organic compounds - Temperature - Thin film circuits - Thin film transistors - Thin films - Zinc oxide","Al-doped ZnO - Bi-layer - Channel layers - High transmittance - Low temperatures - Low-leakage current - Oxygen atmosphere - Sub-threshold swing(ss)","641.1 ThermodynamicsThermodynamics - 701.1 Electricity: Basic Concepts and PhenomenaElectricity: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 712.1.2 Compound Semiconducting MaterialsCompound Semiconducting Materials - 714.2 Semiconductor Devices and Integrated CircuitsSemiconductor Devices and Integrated Circuits - 802.3 Chemical OperationsChemical Operations - 804.2 Inorganic CompoundsInorganic Compounds - 813.1 Coating TechniquesCoating Techniques","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Here, we studied the influence of oxygen vacancies on the magnetoresistance (MR) properties of SrRu1 − xFexO3 - δepitaxial thin films (x = 0.10, 0.20, and 0.30). For this purpose, we synthesized highly strained epitaxial SrRu1 − xFexO3 − δthin films with atomically flat surfaces containing different amounts of oxygen vacancies using pulsed laser deposition. Without an applied magnetic field, the films with x = 0.10 and 0.20 showed a metal–insulator transition, while the x = 0.30 thin film showed insulating behavior over the entire temperature range of 2–300 K. Both Fe doping and the concentration of oxygen vacancies had large effects on the negative MR contributions. For the low Fe doping case of x = 0.10, in which both films exhibited metallic behavior, MR was more prominent in the film with fewer oxygen vacancies or equivalently a more metallic film. For semiconducting films, higher MR was observed for more semiconducting films having more oxygen vacancies. A relatively large negative MR (~36.4%) was observed for the x = 0.30 thin film with a high concentration of oxygen vacancies (δ = 0.12). The obtained results were compared with MR studies for a polycrystal of (Sr1 − xLax)(Ru1 − xFex)O3. These results highlight the crucial role of oxygen stoichiometry in determining the magneto-transport properties in SrRu1 − xFexO3 − δthin films. © 2017, The Author(s).","27","Oxygen vacancies","Deposition - Magnetic field effects - Magnetoresistance - Metal insulator transition - Metals - Oxygen - Pulsed laser deposition - Semiconducting films - Semiconductor doping - Thin films - Transition metal compounds - Transition metals - Transport properties - Vacancies - X ray diffraction","Applied magnetic fields - Atomically flat surface - Epitaxial thin films - Fe-doped - Magneto transport properties - Magnetoresistance properties - Reciprocal space mapping - Transition-metal oxides","531 Metallurgy and MetallographyMetallurgy and Metallography - 701.2 Magnetism: Basic Concepts and PhenomenaMagnetism: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 712.1 Semiconducting MaterialsSemiconducting Materials - 744.9 Laser ApplicationsLaser Applications - 802.3 Chemical OperationsChemical Operations - 804 Chemical Products GenerallyChemical Products Generally - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and SolidsPhysical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids - 933.1 Crystalline SolidsCrystalline Solids","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

As a result of simulation, the optimal interatomic distances of Fe-Ni-C nanocluster was chosen for the simulation, in which height of the potential barrier was maximal and face-centered cubic (FCC) nanocluster was the most stable. It is shown that there were three main positions of a nickel atom that significantly affected nanocluster’s energy. The calculation results indicated that position of the carbon atom in the octahedral interstice was more energetically favorable than tetrahedral interstice in the case of FCC nanocluster.

This equation has been adapted for precipitation in ion exchange materials. Both single nanoparticles (2–20 nm) and their aggregates were found in the polymer. Regulation of salt or acid concentration allows us to decrease size of the aggregates approximately in 10 times. Smaller particles are formed in the resin, which possess lower exchange capacity. Sorption of U(VI) cations from the solution containing also hydrochloride acid was studied. Exchange capacity of the composites is ≈2 times higher in comparison with the pristine resin. The organic-inorganic sorbents show higher sorption rate despite chemical interaction of sorbed ions with functional groups of the inorganic constituent: the models of reaction of pseudo-first or pseudo-second order can be applied.

In this context, a compromise has to be found between the concentration of Erbium and the glass composition. On the one hand, high concentration of Er3+ions helps to reduce the length of the EDF and hence the cumulated attenuation but generally leads to luminescence quenching mechanisms that limit the performances. On the other hand, so as to avoid such quenching effect, glass modifiers like Al3+or P5+ions are used in the fabrication of commercial EDFs but are not suitable for applications in harsh environment because these glass modifiers are precursors of radiation-induced structural defects and consequently of optical losses. In this work, we investigate the concept of smart doping via material nanostructuring as a way to fabricate more efficient optical devices. This approach aims at optimizing the glass composition of the fiber core in order to use the minimal content of glass modifiers needed to reach the suited level of performances for EDFA. Er3+-doped alumina nanoparticles (NPs), as precursor of Er3+ions in the preform fabrication process, were used to control the environment of rare-earth ions and their optical properties.

Upon treating with atomic hydrogen (H*), upward and downward band bending is observed depending on the availability of molecular H2O within the structure of the NRs. In the absence of H2O, the H* treatment demonstrated a cleaning effect of the nanorods, leading to a 0.51 eV upward band bending. In addition, enhancement in the intensity of room temperature photoluminescence (PL) signals due to the creation of new surface defects could be observed. The defects enhanced the visible light activity of the ZnO NRs which were subsequently used to photocatalytically degrade aqueous phenol under simulated sunlight. On the contrary, in the presence of H2O, H* treatment created an electronic accumulation layer inducing downward band bending of 0.45 eV (~1/7th of the bulk ZnO band gap) along with the weakening of the defect signals as observed from room temperature photoluminescence spectra. The results suggest a plausible way of tailoring the band bending and defects of the ZnO NRs through control of H2O/H* species. © 2017, The Author(s).","41","Surface defects","Biodegradation - Energy gap - Hydrogen - Light - Nanorods - Photoluminescence - Surface treatment - Zinc - Zinc oxide","Accumulation layers - Bandbending - Hydrogen treatments - Room temperature photoluminescence spectra - Room-temperature photoluminescence - Visible-light activity - Visible-light photocatalysis - Zinc oxide nanorods","461.8 BiotechnologyBiotechnology - 546.3 Zinc and AlloysZinc and Alloys - 741.1 Light/OpticsLight/Optics - 761 NanotechnologyNanotechnology - 804 Chemical Products GenerallyChemical Products Generally - 804.2 Inorganic CompoundsInorganic Compounds - 933 Solid State PhysicsSolid State Physics - 951 Materials ScienceMaterials Science","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The photoluminescence (PL) characteristics indicate that there exists an optimal location with superior crystalline quality in the CIGS thin films obtained by one-step selenization. The energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) reveals that the Ga lateral distribution in the one-step selenized CIGS thin film is intimately correlated to the blue-shifted PL spectra. The surface morphologies examined by scanning electron microscope (SEM) further suggested that voids and binary phase commonly existing in CIGS films could be successfully eliminated by the present one-step selenization process. The agglomeration phenomenon attributable to the formation of MoSe2layer was also observed. Due to the significant microstructural improvement, the current–voltage (J-V) characteristics and external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the devices made of the present CIGS films have exhibited the remarkable carrier transportation characteristics and photon utilization at the optimal location, resulting in a high conversion efficiency of 11.28%.

A monitoring process was established by the Federal Government to ensure that the targets defined for the transformation will be reached. The indicator system developed for that purpose mainly focuses on “classical” environmental, economic and technological indicators for which statistical time series data and political targets are available. Important socio-technical aspects of the energy system and its transition, such as affordability, participation and acceptance, remain largely neglected. This paper aims to contribute to the discussion on indicators needed for political decision-making to appropriately address sustainability aspects of the energy system and its transition, as well as to contribute to improving existing indicator systems. Therefore, the sustainability rules of the Integrative Concept of Sustainable Development were translated into indicators based on an in-depth literature review. The resulting abundance of possible indicators was then reduced using selection criteria such as comprehensiveness, possibility to determine targets and availability of data. Finally, the indicator system was adjusted based on feedback of experts from different disciplines and stakeholder interviews in the particular investigation area of southwest Thuringia. Besides classical indicators related to techno-economic and environmental aspects, the finally developed indicator system includes new sustainability indicators related to the socio-technical interface of the energy system. Thus, it is considered suitable for assessing the sustainability of the Germany energy system and its transition in an integrative and comprehensive way. The indicator system is helpful to systematically identify strengths and weaknesses of the energy system and interdependencies and conflicts of goals between different sustainability aspects. All in all, we believe that applying the indicator system appropriately can support the development of resilient political strategies for a successful energy transition. © 2017, The Author(s).","65","Sustainable development","Climate change - Decision making - Fossil fuels - Indicators (instruments) - Planning","Assessment - Energy systems - Energy transitions - Environmental aspects - Federal governments - Socio-technical aspects - Sustainability assessment - Sustainability indicators","443.1 Atmospheric PropertiesAtmospheric Properties - 912.2 ManagementManagement","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Experiments have shown that changes of frequencies of the most intensive bands arising from the in-plane, E2g1, and out-of-plane, A1g, vibrations, as a function of number n of layers looks differently. Thus, the frequency of ω(A1g) is increasing with growth of n, whereas the frequency of ω(E2g1) is decreasing. Such a change of the ω(E2g1) frequency was explained as the effect of “strong increase of the dielectric tensor when going from single layer to the bulk” sample. In the present work, we show that the reason of different dependences of frequencies can be related to both the van der Waals (vdW) interlayer interaction and the anharmonic interaction of noted fundamental vibrations with the corresponding combination tones (CT) of layer that manifests itself due to Fermi resonance in the layer. Overjumping of these phonon pairs (s, s ') owing to interlayer interaction, V˜(s,s',qp), to other layers at growth of number n, results in the change of frequencies for each interacting pair of A1gor E2g1 symmetry.

In this present study, NiSi (20 nm)/Si (40 nm) and AlSi (20 nm)/Si (40 nm) bilayer thin films are deposited through radio frequency (RF) sputtering at room temperature. The influence of the film’s composition and the annealing temperature on the film’s optical absorption is investigated. The results show that all the NiSi/Si films and AlSi/Si films possess higher absorption ability compared to a pure a-Si film (60 nm). After annealing from 400 to 600 °C under vacuum for 1 h, the Si layer remains amorphous in both NiSi/Si films and AlSi/Si films, while the NiSi layer crystallizes into NiSi2phase, whereas Al atoms diffuse through the whole film during the annealing process. Consequently, with increasing the annealing temperature, the optical absorption of NiSi/Si films increases, while that of AlSi/Si films obviously degrades. © 2017, The Author(s).","30","Amorphous films","Amorphous silicon - Annealing - Electromagnetic wave absorption - Light absorption - Metal analysis - Metal nanoparticles - Silicides - Silicon - Thin films","Absorption abilities - Amorphous Si films - Annealing process - Annealing temperatures - Bilayer thin films - Metal silicide - Radio-frequency sputtering - Rf-sputtering","537.1 Heat Treatment ProcessesHeat Treatment Processes - 549.3 Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals - 711 Electromagnetic WavesElectromagnetic Waves - 741.1 Light/OpticsLight/Optics - 761 NanotechnologyNanotechnology - 804 Chemical Products GenerallyChemical Products Generally - 933.2 Amorphous SolidsAmorphous Solids","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Using the spray method to eliminate the impact on the rear side, single-side black silicon was obtained on n-type solar grade silicon wafers. Post-etch treatment with NH4OH/H2O2/H2O mixed solution not only smoothes the surface but also increases the effective minority lifetime from 161 μs of as-prepared wafer to 333 μs after cleaning.

The HPT-GWS probe is designed for direct push advancement into unconsolidated formations. The system provides both injection pressure logs and electrical conductivity (EC) logs, and groundwater may be sampled at multiple depths as the probe is advanced (profiling). The combination of these three capabilities in one probe has not previously been available. During field work it was observed that when HPT corrected pressure (Pc) indicates a consistent aquifer unit then bulk formation EC can be used as an indicator of water quality. A high correlation coefficient (R2= 0.93) was observed between groundwater specific conductance and bulk formation EC in the sands and gravels of the alluvial aquifer studied. These results indicate that groundwater specific conductance is exerting a controlling influence on the bulk formation EC of the coarse-grained unit at this site, and probably many similar sites, consistent with Archie's Law. This simple relationship enables the use of the EC and Pclogs, with targeted water samples and a minimum of core samples, to rapidly assess groundwater quality over extended areas at high vertical resolution. This method was used to identify both a brine impacted zone at the base of the aquifer investigated and a groundwater recharge lens developing below storm water holding ponds in the upper portion of the same aquifer. Sample results for trace level, naturally occurring elements (As, Ba, U) further demonstrate the use of this system to sample for low level groundwater contamination. © 2016, National Ground Water Association","40","Recharging (underground waters)","Aquifers - Groundwater - Groundwater pollution - Groundwater resources - Probes - Quality control - Trace elements - Uranium - Water quality","Correlation coefficient - Electrical conductivity - Ground water recharge - Groundwater contamination - Groundwater monitoring - High vertical resolution - Specific conductance - Unconsolidated formations",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Up to now, indium tin oxide (ITO) films have been widely used as transparent conductive electrodes (TCE) in organic opto-electronic devices. However, ITO films, typically deposited on glass are brittle and they make it difficult to produce flexible devices, restricting their use for flexible devices. In this study, we report on a nano-composite TCE, which is made of a silver nanowire (AgNW) network, combined with aluminum-doped zinc oxide (ZnO:Al, AZO) by atomic layer deposition. The AgNWs/AZO composite electrode on photopolymer substrate shows a low sheet resistance of only 8.6 Ω/sq and a high optical transmittance of about 83% at 550 nm. These values are even comparable to conventional ITO on glass. In addition, the electrodes also have a very smooth surface (0.31 nm root-mean-square roughness), which is flat enough to contact the OLED stack. Flexible OLED were built with AgNWs/AZO electrodes, which suggests that this approach can replace conventional ITO TCEs in organic electronic devices in the future. © 2017, The Author(s).","28","Electron devices","Aluminum - Aluminum coatings - Atomic layer deposition - Conductive films - Current density - Deposition - Electric resistance measurement - Electrodes - Electronic equipment - Glass - ITO glass - Light emission - Nanocomposites - Nanowires - Optical films - Optoelectronic devices - Oxide films - Quantum efficiency - Silver - Thermoelectric equipment - Tin oxides - Zinc oxide","Al-doped ZnO - Aluminum-doped zinc oxide - Flexible organic light emitting devices - Organic electronic devices - Organic light-emitting devices - Root mean square roughness - Silver nanowires - Transparent conductive electrodes","541.1 AluminumAluminum - 547.1 Precious MetalsPrecious Metals - 615.4 Thermoelectric EnergyThermoelectric Energy - 701.1 Electricity: Basic Concepts and PhenomenaElectricity: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 708.2 Conducting MaterialsConducting Materials - 741.1 Light/OpticsLight/Optics - 741.3 Optical Devices and SystemsOptical Devices and Systems - 761 NanotechnologyNanotechnology - 802.3 Chemical OperationsChemical Operations - 804.2 Inorganic CompoundsInorganic Compounds - 812.3 GlassGlass - 813.1 Coating TechniquesCoating Techniques - 813.2 Coating MaterialsCoating Materials - 931.4 Quantum Theory; Quantum MechanicsQuantum Theory; Quantum Mechanics - 933 Solid State PhysicsSolid State Physics - 933.1.2 Crystal GrowthCrystal Growth - 942.2 Electric Variables MeasurementsElectric Variables Measurements","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The influences of the different sealing layers added in the coatings on the microstructure, surface roughness, and corrosion behaviors were investigated. The results indicated that the sealing layer added by ALD significantly decreased the average grain size and improved the corrosion resistance of the CrN coatings.

This work modified the surface of the TNTAs/QDs photoelectrodes with metal-oxide overlayers by atomic layer deposition (ALD), such as coating Al2O3, TiO2, and ZnO. The ALD deposition of all these overlayers can apparently enhance the photoelectrochemical performance of the TNTAs/QDs. Under simulated solar illumination, the maximum photocurrent densities of the TNTAs/QDs with 10 cycles ZnO, 25 cycles TiO2, and 30 cycles Al2O3overlayers are 5.0, 4.3, and 5.6 mA/cm2at 1.0 V (vs. SCE), respectively.

Systematic examination of the effects of various metal-oxide overlayers on the photoelectrochemical performance indicates that the enhancement by TiO2and ZnO overcoatings can only ascribed to the decrease of the interfacial charge transfer impedance, besides which Al2O3coating can passivate the surface states and facilitate the charge transfer kinetics.

In addition, the influence of vertical electric field on the electronic band structures of the systems was carefully examined. Analyzing the adsorption energies of transition metals given by the PBE calculations, we found that the benzene molecule stabilized the binding of Cr and Mn on the MoS2surface, but destabilized the Fe binding by approximately 33% of adsorption energy. The attachment of benzene caused modifications on the total magnetizations of the Cr-MoS2and Mn-MoS2structures. The Bz-Mn@MoS2structure was found to exhibit half-metallicity with 100% spin polarization at the Fermi level.

The response of the liquid crystal to competing surface orientations, typical of patterned substrates, is determined by the anisotropy of the elastic constants and the interplay of the relevant lengths scales, such as the correlation length and the surface geometrical parameters. Transitions between different textures, usually with different symmetries, may occur under a wide range of conditions. We use the Landau-de Gennes free energy to investigate the texture of nematics in sinusoidal channels with parallel anchoring bounded by nematic-air interfaces that favour perpendicular (hometropic) anchoring. In micron size channels 5CB was observed to exhibit a non-trivial texture characterized by a disclination line, within the channel, which is broken into a zigzag pattern. Our calculations reveal that when the elastic anisotropy of the nematic does not favour twist distortions the defect is a straight disclination line that runs along the channel, which breaks into a zigzag pattern with a characteristic period, when the twist elastic constant becomes sufficiently small when compared to the splay and bend constants. The transition occurs through a twist instability that drives the defect line to rotate from its original position. The interplay between the energetically favourable twist distortions that induce the defect rotation and the liquid crystal anchoring at the surfaces leads to the zigzag pattern. We investigate in detail the dependence of the periodicity of the zigzag pattern on the geometrical parameters of the sinusoidal channels, which in line with the experimental results is found to be non-linear. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.","25","Nematic liquid crystals","Anisotropy - Crystal defects - Crystal orientation - Elastic constants - Free energy - Geometry - Liquid crystals - Liquids","Correlation lengths - Elastic instabilities - Landau-de Gennes free energy - Patterned substrates - Sinusoidal channels - Surface orientation - Topological defect - Twist elastic constant","641.1 ThermodynamicsThermodynamics - 921 MathematicsMathematics - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and SolidsPhysical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids - 933.1.1 Crystal LatticeCrystal Lattice","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The particles were powdered using a freeze-dry method and dispersed in poly(vinyl chloride) by melt blending. Dynamic mechanical analysis indicated that the non-crosslinked particles were completely compatible. In contrast, mutual diffusion of the polymer chains in the crosslinked particles was restricted within the particle/matrix interfacial layer. As a result, an incompatible phase structure in which the crosslinked particles were dispersed in the continuous phase was formed. Pulse NMR analysis indicated that the interfacial layer thickness was in the range of 17–98 nm. The thickness decreased with an increase in the degree of crosslinking in the particles. The interfacial layer thickness in the particles was approximately 10 times larger than that for the incompatible polymer pair.

Therefore, authors of this paper carried out a comparative analysis of TiO2layers produced both using chemical (ALD) and electrochemical (anodic oxidation) methods. The study was performed based on evaluation of electrochemical properties of produced TiO2 layer on the Ti6Al7Nb substrate alloy. As a part of electrochemical properties testing, potentiodynamic, potentiostatic and impedance studies were performed.

The data set presented in this study represents the first complete237Np vertical profiles (0.12–0.27 μBq L− 1), and constitutes a baseline measurement to assess future changes. A similar behavior of Cs and Np has been evidenced, confirming that Np behaves conservatively. While the137Cs decrease has been driven by its radioactive decay, the vertical distribution of237Np has not substantially changed over the last decade. In the absence of recent major inputs, a homogenization of their vertical distribution occurred, partly due to deep convection events that became more intense during the last decade. In contrast,239+240Pu surface levels in the NW Mediterranean waters have fallen in the past four decades by a factor of 5. This decrease in surface has been balanced by higher concentrations in the deep-water layers. A first estimate of the downward239+240Pu fluxes in the NW Mediterranean Sea is proposed over more than two decades. This estimation, based on the DYFAMED sediment trap time-series data and published239+240Pu flux measurements, suggests that sinking particles have accounted for 60–90% of the upper layer (0–200 m) Pu inventory loss over the period 1989–2013. The upper layer residence time of Pu is estimated to be ~ 28 years, twice as long as the residence time estimated for the whole western Mediterranean (~ 15 years). This difference highlights the slow removal of Pu in the open waters of the NW Mediterranean and confirms that most of the Pu removal occurs along the coastal margin where sedimentation rates are high. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","93","Residence time distribution","Nuclear fuels","DYFAMED - Marine tracer - Northwestern Mediterranean - Plutonium isotopes - Vertical exports","922.1 Probability TheoryProbability Theory","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Emulsions were subsequently screened against several challenge pathogens to evaluate antimicrobial efficacy. Based on these time-kill assays, exemplary formulations were further tested as sanitizing washes on lettuce and blueberries inoculated with food-borne bacterial biofilms.

The diagnosis of the different types of neoplasia is made by a specialist through the analysis of histological images. However, these analyses are complex and the same case can lead to different understandings among pathologists, due to the exhaustive analysis of decisions, the time required and the presence of complex histological features. In this context, computational algorithms can be applied as tools to aid specialists through the application of segmentation methods to identify regions of interest that are essential for lymphomas diagnosis. In this paper, an unsupervised method for segmentation of nuclear components of neoplastic cells is proposed to analyze histological images of lymphoma stained with hematoxylin-eosin. The proposed method is based on the association among histogram equalization, Gaussian filter, fuzzy 3-partition entropy, genetic algorithm, morphological techniques and the valley-emphasis method in order to analyze neoplastic nuclear components, improve the contrast and illumination conditions, remove noise, split overlapping cells and refine contours. The results were evaluated through comparisons with those provided by a specialist and techniques available in the literature considering the metrics of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and variation of information. The mean value of accuracy for the proposed method was 81.48%. Although the method obtained sensitivity rates between 41% and 51%, the accuracy values showed relevance when compared to those provided by other studies. Therefore, the novelties presented here may already encourage new studies with a more comprehensive overview of lymphoma segmentation. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","83","Image segmentation","Diseases - Entropy - Fuzzy filters - Genetic algorithms - Image analysis - Object recognition - Oncology - Sensitivity analysis","Computational algorithm - Fuzzy 3-partition - Histological images - Illumination conditions - Lymphoma - Unsupervised segmentation - Valley-emphasis - Variation of informations","461.6 Medicine and PharmacologyMedicine and Pharmacology - 641.1 ThermodynamicsThermodynamics - 723 Computer Software, Data Handling and ApplicationsComputer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 921 MathematicsMathematics","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

With the continual development of information, communication, and sensor technologies, Condition-Based Maintenance (CBM) policies have gained popularity in industries. A successfully implemented CBM reduces the losses due to equipment failure by intelligently maintaining the equipment before catastrophic failures occur. However, effective CBM requires an effective fault analysis method based on gathered sensor data.

One of the important factors influencing the stability of a bacterial structure but also important in the context of an infection is the adhesion force. In order to model the sticking process over time, two theoretical models for bacteria are presented. These models allow to simulate the sticking process numerically. As the model complexity, may affect the calculation time, in this paper we derive two theoretical models of different complexity. One is a simple, adhesive viscous elastic, the other a more complex adhesive viscous elastic-plastic model. Both models can be applied to the simulation of the dynamics of bacteria. Thereby forces act when the bacterium is at a distance to a surface as well as during its contact. The attractive force is described by the van der Waals force by applying an adhesive-dissipative model. For the description of the bacterium within a liquid medium electrostatic double-layer and steric force models are additionally considered. In the attractive-dissipative sticking process viscous damping forces were considered, which results in the theoretically expected load-unload behaviour. The sticking process of a bacterium on a substrate is solved by applying the discrete element method. The bacterium addressed is S. aureus; while as substrate glass is considered. The parameters needed for the numerical simulation of this bacterium are taken from published physical experiments performed with atomic force measurements.

A novel method of rolling bearings fault diagnosis based on variational mode decomposition is presented in this contribution. The rolling bearing fault signal calculating model of different location defect is established by failure mechanism analysis, and the simulation vibration signal of the proposed fault model is investigated by FFT and envelope analysis. A comparison has gone to evaluate the performance of bearing defect characteristic extraction for rolling bearings simulation signal by using VMD and EMD. The result of comparison verifies the VMD can accurately extract the principal mode of bearing fault signal, and it better than EMD in bearing defect characteristic extraction. The VMD is then applied to detect different location fault features for rolling bearings fault diagnosis via modeling simulation vibration signal and practical vibration signal.

During the GEOTRACES GA04S-MedSeA expedition in 2013 seawater was collected from 10 vertical profiles covering the principal sub–basins of the Mediterranean Sea. The main objective was to understand the distributions of236U and129I in relation to the water masses, and to constrain their sources in this region. The236U/238U atom ratios and the129I concentrations ranged from (710 ± 40) × 10− 12to (2220 ± 60) × 10− 12and from (4.0 ± 0.1) × 107to (13.8 ± 0.3) × 107 at·kg− 1, respectively. The results show that radionuclide–poor Atlantic Water is entering at the surface through the Strait of Gibraltar whereas comparably radionuclide-enriched Levantine Intermediate Water is sinking in the Eastern Basin and flowing westward at intermediate depths. Low radionuclide levels were found in the oldest water masses at about 1000–2000 m depth in the Eastern Basin. At greater depths, waters were relatively enriched in236U and129I due to dense water formation occurring in both, the Eastern and Western Basins. The inventories of236U and129I cannot be explained only by global fallout from atmospheric nuclear bomb testings carried out in the 1950s and 1960s. We estimate that the liquid input of236U from the nuclear reprocessing facility of Marcoule (France), via the Rhône river, was of the same order of magnitude than the contribution from global fallout, whereas liquid and gaseous releases of129I from Marcoule were up to two orders of magnitude higher than global fallout.

In this article, the authors report on ALE of Si, Ge, C, W, GaN, and SiO2using a directional (anisotropic) plasma-enhanced approach. The authors analyze these systems by defining an “ALE synergy” parameter which quantifies the degree to which a process approaches the ideal ALE regime. This parameter is inspired by the ion-neutral synergy concept introduced in the 1979 paper by Coburn and Winters [J. Appl. Phys. 50, 5 (1979)]. ALE synergy is related to the energetics of underlying surface interactions and is understood in terms of energy criteria for the energy barriers involved in the reactions. Synergistic behavior is observed for all of the systems studied, with each exhibiting behavior unique to the reactant-material combination. By systematically studying atomic layer etching of a group of materials, the authors show that ALE synergy scales with the surface binding energy of the bulk material. This insight explains why some materials are more or less amenable to the directional ALE approach. They conclude that ALE is both simpler to understand than conventional plasma etch processing and is applicable to metals, semiconductors, and dielectrics. © 2017 Author(s).","34","Etching","Atoms - Binding energy - Dielectric materials - Germanium","Atomic layer etching - Energy criterion - Material combination - Multistep process - Process approach - Surface binding energies - Ultrathin layers - Underlying surface","549.3 Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals - 708.1 Dielectric MaterialsDielectric Materials - 801.4 Physical ChemistryPhysical Chemistry - 802.2 Chemical ReactionsChemical Reactions - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular PhysicsAtomic and Molecular Physics","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Boiling histotripsy (BH) is applied for mechanical fragmentation of soft tissue into submicron fragments with limited temperature increase using the shock wave and cavitation effects of HIFU. Research on BH has been largely limited to ex vivo experiments. As a consequence, the in vivo pathology after BH treatment and the relation to preexistent tissue characteristics are not well understood. This study reports on in vivo MR guided BH treatment, either with 100 or 200 pulses per focal spot, in three different subcutaneous mouse tumor models: a soft-tissue melanoma (B16OVA), a compact growing thymoma (EL4), and a highly vascularized neuroblastoma (9464D). Extensive treatment evaluation was performed using MR imaging followed by histopathology 2 h after treatment. T2 weighted MRI allowed direct in vivo visualization of the BH lesions in all tumor models. The 100-pulse treated area in the B16OVA tumors was larger than the predicted treatment volume (500 ± 10%). For the more compact growing EL4 and 9464D tumors this was 95 ± 13% and 55 ± 33%, respectively. Histopathology after the 100-pulse treatment revealed completely disintegrated lesions in the treated area with sharp borders in the compact EL4 and 9464D tumors, while for B16OVA tumors the lesion contained a mixture of discohesive (partly viable) clusters of cells, micro-vessel remainings, and tumor cell debris. The treatment of B16OVA with 200 pulses increased the fragmentation of tumor tissue. In all tumor types only micro-hemorrhages were detected after ablation (slightly higher after 200-pulse treatment for the highly vascularized 9464D tumors). Collagen staining revealed that the collagen fibers were to a greater or lesser extent still intact and partly clotted together near the lesion border in all tumor models. In conclusion, this study reveals effective mechanical fragmentation of different tumor types using BH without major hemorrhages. However, treatment settings may need to be adjusted to the tissue characteristics for optimal tissue fragmentation. © 2017","40","Tumors","Ablation - Collagen - Magnetic resonance imaging - Shock waves - Tissue","After-treatment - Cavitation effect - High intensity focused ultrasound - T2-weighted mris - Temperature increase - Tissue characteristics - Treatment volumes - Tumor ablation","461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue EngineeringBiological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 641.2 Heat TransferHeat Transfer - 746 Imaging TechniquesImaging Techniques - 931 Classical Physics; Quantum Theory; RelativityClassical Physics; Quantum Theory; Relativity","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The PbSe films were oxidized at 380°C for 30 min and then iodinated at different iodine vapor pressures at 380°C for 5 min. When the iodine vapor pressure was below 20 Pa, PbSeO3 was the main phase formed on the surface of PbSe microcrystals for both undoped and iodine-doped films.

During steam treatment, pyrolysis products appear to have restrained molecular motions of the steam-heated bamboo, while cleavage of lignin increased molecular motion of the OCH3group. Bamboo treated with pressurized steam retained its hemicellulose and produced a smaller amount of pyrolysis products, while both hemicellulose and lignin were reduced by treatment with NaOH solution.

Among these demands is the frequent need to simultaneously etch features with a wide variety of aspect ratios (AR) on the same wafer. Many plasma etching processes exhibit aspect ratio dependent etching (ARDE) - different etch rates for features that have different aspect ratios, usually slower for larger AR. Processes subject to ARDE require over-etch to clear the larger AR features, which increases the need for high selectivity and low damage. Despite these issues, the physical processes which contribute to ARDE are not well understood. In this paper, results are discussed from a computational investigation on the root causes of ARDE during Ar/Cl2plasma etching of Si, and, in particular, the role which neutral transport plays in this process. Parametric studies were performed varying neutral-to-ion flux ratios, surface recombination rates of atomic Cl, and neutral and ion angular distributions to determine their influence on neutral transport of Cl to the etch front and ARDE. It was found that each parameter has a significant influence on neutral transport to the etch front (with the exception of the ion angular distribution). Methods for increasing neutral flux (for a given set of ion fluxes) to the etch front were found to push the system toward a neutral saturated, ion starved regime which alleviates ARDE for some range of AR. Increased neutral flux is also correlated with more tapered features, which tend to exhibit more significant ARDE. This coupling of neutral transport with feature profiles makes it difficult to alleviate all ARDE in this system. However, it is possible to optimize parameters in such a way to postpone the onset of ARDE to fairly large AR (>8). © 2017 American Vacuum Society.","45","Aspect ratio","Alpha particles - Angular distribution - Ions - Plasma etching - Semiconductor device structures - Semiconductor devices - Silicon wafers","Aspect ratio dependent etchings - Computational investigation - Ion angular distribution - Neutral transport - Plasma etching process - Surface recombinations - Three dimensional (3D) structures - Unprecedented demand","714.2 Semiconductor Devices and Integrated CircuitsSemiconductor Devices and Integrated Circuits - 802.2 Chemical ReactionsChemical Reactions - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular PhysicsAtomic and Molecular Physics","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In this area, spatial variability of arsenic is high, peaking at 241 μg/L. Forty-seven percent of samples collected contained arsenic above the maximum allowable concentration for drinking water (10 μg/L). Correlations of As with other hydrochemical variables were investigated using multivariate statistical analysis (Hierarchical Cluster Analysis, HCA and Principal Component Analysis, PCA). It was found that As, V, Cr and pH are closely related and that there were also close correlations with temperature and Na+. The highest concentrations of arsenic and other associated Potentially Toxic Geogenic Trace Elements (PTGTE) are linked to alkaline NaHCO3waters (pH ≈ 9), moderate oxic conditions and temperatures of around 18 °C–19 °C. The most plausible hypothesis to explain the high arsenic concentrations is the contribution of deeper regional flows with a significant hydrothermal component (cold-hydrothermal waters), flowing through faults in the basement rock. Water mixing and water-rock interactions occur both in the fissured aquifer media (igneous and metasedimentary bedrock) and in the sedimentary environment of the CDB, where agricultural pollution phenomena are also active. A combination of multivariate statistical tools and hydrochemical analysis enabled the distribution pattern of dissolved As and other PTGTE in groundwaters in the study area to be interpreted, and their most likely origin to be established.
