Here, we studied the influence of oxygen vacancies on the magnetoresistance (MR) properties of SrRu1 − xFexO3 - δepitaxial thin films (x = 0.10, 0.20, and 0.30). For this purpose, we synthesized highly strained epitaxial SrRu1 − xFexO3 − δthin films with atomically flat surfaces containing different amounts of oxygen vacancies using pulsed laser deposition. Without an applied magnetic field, the films with x = 0.10 and 0.20 showed a metal–insulator transition, while the x = 0.30 thin film showed insulating behavior over the entire temperature range of 2–300 K. Both Fe doping and the concentration of oxygen vacancies had large effects on the negative MR contributions. For the low Fe doping case of x = 0.10, in which both films exhibited metallic behavior, MR was more prominent in the film with fewer oxygen vacancies or equivalently a more metallic film. For semiconducting films, higher MR was observed for more semiconducting films having more oxygen vacancies. A relatively large negative MR (~36.4%) was observed for the x = 0.30 thin film with a high concentration of oxygen vacancies (δ = 0.12). The obtained results were compared with MR studies for a polycrystal of (Sr1 − xLax)(Ru1 − xFex)O3. These results highlight the crucial role of oxygen stoichiometry in determining the magneto-transport properties in SrRu1 − xFexO3 − δthin films. © 2017, The Author(s).","27","Oxygen vacancies","Deposition - Magnetic field effects - Magnetoresistance - Metal insulator transition - Metals - Oxygen - Pulsed laser deposition - Semiconducting films - Semiconductor doping - Thin films - Transition metal compounds - Transition metals - Transport properties - Vacancies - X ray diffraction","Applied magnetic fields - Atomically flat surface - Epitaxial thin films - Fe-doped - Magneto transport properties - Magnetoresistance properties - Reciprocal space mapping - Transition-metal oxides","531 Metallurgy and MetallographyMetallurgy and Metallography - 701.2 Magnetism: Basic Concepts and PhenomenaMagnetism: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 712.1 Semiconducting MaterialsSemiconducting Materials - 744.9 Laser ApplicationsLaser Applications - 802.3 Chemical OperationsChemical Operations - 804 Chemical Products GenerallyChemical Products Generally - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and SolidsPhysical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids - 933.1 Crystalline SolidsCrystalline Solids","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

These results suggest a convenient solution to form lateral SiGe nanowires covering multi-faceted surfaces on the patterned template. © 2017, The Author(s).","45","Finite element method","Atomic force microscopy - Germanium - Molecular beam epitaxy - Nanowires - Silicon - Silicon alloys - Thermal barrier coatings","Faceted surfaces - Finite element simulations - Patterned template - Si-Ge nanowires - Total energy - Vacancy sites","549.3 Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals - 741.3 Optical Devices and SystemsOptical Devices and Systems - 761 NanotechnologyNanotechnology - 921.6 Numerical MethodsNumerical Methods - 933 Solid State PhysicsSolid State Physics - 933.1.2 Crystal GrowthCrystal Growth","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The energy of the nanocluster was estimated at the different interatomic distances. As a result of simulation, the optimal interatomic distances of Fe-Ni-C nanocluster was chosen for the simulation, in which height of the potential barrier was maximal and face-centered cubic (FCC) nanocluster was the most stable. It is shown that there were three main positions of a nickel atom that significantly affected nanocluster’s energy. The calculation results indicated that position of the carbon atom in the octahedral interstice was more energetically favorable than tetrahedral interstice in the case of FCC nanocluster.

This equation has been adapted for precipitation in ion exchange materials. Both single nanoparticles (2–20 nm) and their aggregates were found in the polymer. Regulation of salt or acid concentration allows us to decrease size of the aggregates approximately in 10 times. Smaller particles are formed in the resin, which possess lower exchange capacity. Sorption of U(VI) cations from the solution containing also hydrochloride acid was studied. Exchange capacity of the composites is ≈2 times higher in comparison with the pristine resin. The organic-inorganic sorbents show higher sorption rate despite chemical interaction of sorbed ions with functional groups of the inorganic constituent: the models of reaction of pseudo-first or pseudo-second order can be applied.

In this context, a compromise has to be found between the concentration of Erbium and the glass composition. On the one hand, high concentration of Er3+ions helps to reduce the length of the EDF and hence the cumulated attenuation but generally leads to luminescence quenching mechanisms that limit the performances. On the other hand, so as to avoid such quenching effect, glass modifiers like Al3+or P5+ions are used in the fabrication of commercial EDFs but are not suitable for applications in harsh environment because these glass modifiers are precursors of radiation-induced structural defects and consequently of optical losses. In this work, we investigate the concept of smart doping via material nanostructuring as a way to fabricate more efficient optical devices. This approach aims at optimizing the glass composition of the fiber core in order to use the minimal content of glass modifiers needed to reach the suited level of performances for EDFA. Er3+-doped alumina nanoparticles (NPs), as precursor of Er3+ions in the preform fabrication process, were used to control the environment of rare-earth ions and their optical properties.

Upon treating with atomic hydrogen (H*), upward and downward band bending is observed depending on the availability of molecular H2O within the structure of the NRs. In the absence of H2O, the H* treatment demonstrated a cleaning effect of the nanorods, leading to a 0.51 eV upward band bending. In addition, enhancement in the intensity of room temperature photoluminescence (PL) signals due to the creation of new surface defects could be observed. The defects enhanced the visible light activity of the ZnO NRs which were subsequently used to photocatalytically degrade aqueous phenol under simulated sunlight. On the contrary, in the presence of H2O, H* treatment created an electronic accumulation layer inducing downward band bending of 0.45 eV (~1/7th of the bulk ZnO band gap) along with the weakening of the defect signals as observed from room temperature photoluminescence spectra. The results suggest a plausible way of tailoring the band bending and defects of the ZnO NRs through control of H2O/H* species. © 2017, The Author(s).","41","Surface defects","Biodegradation - Energy gap - Hydrogen - Light - Nanorods - Photoluminescence - Surface treatment - Zinc - Zinc oxide","Accumulation layers - Bandbending - Hydrogen treatments - Room temperature photoluminescence spectra - Room-temperature photoluminescence - Visible-light activity - Visible-light photocatalysis - Zinc oxide nanorods","461.8 BiotechnologyBiotechnology - 546.3 Zinc and AlloysZinc and Alloys - 741.1 Light/OpticsLight/Optics - 761 NanotechnologyNanotechnology - 804 Chemical Products GenerallyChemical Products Generally - 804.2 Inorganic CompoundsInorganic Compounds - 933 Solid State PhysicsSolid State Physics - 951 Materials ScienceMaterials Science","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The photoluminescence (PL) characteristics indicate that there exists an optimal location with superior crystalline quality in the CIGS thin films obtained by one-step selenization. The energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) reveals that the Ga lateral distribution in the one-step selenized CIGS thin film is intimately correlated to the blue-shifted PL spectra. The surface morphologies examined by scanning electron microscope (SEM) further suggested that voids and binary phase commonly existing in CIGS films could be successfully eliminated by the present one-step selenization process. The agglomeration phenomenon attributable to the formation of MoSe2layer was also observed. Due to the significant microstructural improvement, the current–voltage (J-V) characteristics and external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the devices made of the present CIGS films have exhibited the remarkable carrier transportation characteristics and photon utilization at the optimal location, resulting in a high conversion efficiency of 11.28%.

A monitoring process was established by the Federal Government to ensure that the targets defined for the transformation will be reached. The indicator system developed for that purpose mainly focuses on “classical” environmental, economic and technological indicators for which statistical time series data and political targets are available. Important socio-technical aspects of the energy system and its transition, such as affordability, participation and acceptance, remain largely neglected. This paper aims to contribute to the discussion on indicators needed for political decision-making to appropriately address sustainability aspects of the energy system and its transition, as well as to contribute to improving existing indicator systems. Therefore, the sustainability rules of the Integrative Concept of Sustainable Development were translated into indicators based on an in-depth literature review. The resulting abundance of possible indicators was then reduced using selection criteria such as comprehensiveness, possibility to determine targets and availability of data. Finally, the indicator system was adjusted based on feedback of experts from different disciplines and stakeholder interviews in the particular investigation area of southwest Thuringia. Besides classical indicators related to techno-economic and environmental aspects, the finally developed indicator system includes new sustainability indicators related to the socio-technical interface of the energy system. Thus, it is considered suitable for assessing the sustainability of the Germany energy system and its transition in an integrative and comprehensive way. The indicator system is helpful to systematically identify strengths and weaknesses of the energy system and interdependencies and conflicts of goals between different sustainability aspects. All in all, we believe that applying the indicator system appropriately can support the development of resilient political strategies for a successful energy transition. © 2017, The Author(s).","65","Sustainable development","Climate change - Decision making - Fossil fuels - Indicators (instruments) - Planning","Assessment - Energy systems - Energy transitions - Environmental aspects - Federal governments - Socio-technical aspects - Sustainability assessment - Sustainability indicators","443.1 Atmospheric PropertiesAtmospheric Properties - 912.2 ManagementManagement","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Experiments have shown that changes of frequencies of the most intensive bands arising from the in-plane, E2g1, and out-of-plane, A1g, vibrations, as a function of number n of layers looks differently. Thus, the frequency of ω(A1g) is increasing with growth of n, whereas the frequency of ω(E2g1) is decreasing. Such a change of the ω(E2g1) frequency was explained as the effect of “strong increase of the dielectric tensor when going from single layer to the bulk” sample. In the present work, we show that the reason of different dependences of frequencies can be related to both the van der Waals (vdW) interlayer interaction and the anharmonic interaction of noted fundamental vibrations with the corresponding combination tones (CT) of layer that manifests itself due to Fermi resonance in the layer. Overjumping of these phonon pairs (s, s ') owing to interlayer interaction, V˜(s,s',qp), to other layers at growth of number n, results in the change of frequencies for each interacting pair of A1gor E2g1 symmetry.

In this present study, NiSi (20 nm)/Si (40 nm) and AlSi (20 nm)/Si (40 nm) bilayer thin films are deposited through radio frequency (RF) sputtering at room temperature. The influence of the film’s composition and the annealing temperature on the film’s optical absorption is investigated. The results show that all the NiSi/Si films and AlSi/Si films possess higher absorption ability compared to a pure a-Si film (60 nm). After annealing from 400 to 600 °C under vacuum for 1 h, the Si layer remains amorphous in both NiSi/Si films and AlSi/Si films, while the NiSi layer crystallizes into NiSi2phase, whereas Al atoms diffuse through the whole film during the annealing process. Consequently, with increasing the annealing temperature, the optical absorption of NiSi/Si films increases, while that of AlSi/Si films obviously degrades. © 2017, The Author(s).","30","Amorphous films","Amorphous silicon - Annealing - Electromagnetic wave absorption - Light absorption - Metal analysis - Metal nanoparticles - Silicides - Silicon - Thin films","Absorption abilities - Amorphous Si films - Annealing process - Annealing temperatures - Bilayer thin films - Metal silicide - Radio-frequency sputtering - Rf-sputtering","537.1 Heat Treatment ProcessesHeat Treatment Processes - 549.3 Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals - 711 Electromagnetic WavesElectromagnetic Waves - 741.1 Light/OpticsLight/Optics - 761 NanotechnologyNanotechnology - 804 Chemical Products GenerallyChemical Products Generally - 933.2 Amorphous SolidsAmorphous Solids","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Using the spray method to eliminate the impact on the rear side, single-side black silicon was obtained on n-type solar grade silicon wafers. Post-etch treatment with NH4OH/H2O2/H2O mixed solution not only smoothes the surface but also increases the effective minority lifetime from 161 μs of as-prepared wafer to 333 μs after cleaning.

The HPT-GWS probe is designed for direct push advancement into unconsolidated formations. The system provides both injection pressure logs and electrical conductivity (EC) logs, and groundwater may be sampled at multiple depths as the probe is advanced (profiling). The combination of these three capabilities in one probe has not previously been available. During field work it was observed that when HPT corrected pressure (Pc) indicates a consistent aquifer unit then bulk formation EC can be used as an indicator of water quality. A high correlation coefficient (R2= 0.93) was observed between groundwater specific conductance and bulk formation EC in the sands and gravels of the alluvial aquifer studied. These results indicate that groundwater specific conductance is exerting a controlling influence on the bulk formation EC of the coarse-grained unit at this site, and probably many similar sites, consistent with Archie's Law. This simple relationship enables the use of the EC and Pclogs, with targeted water samples and a minimum of core samples, to rapidly assess groundwater quality over extended areas at high vertical resolution. This method was used to identify both a brine impacted zone at the base of the aquifer investigated and a groundwater recharge lens developing below storm water holding ponds in the upper portion of the same aquifer. Sample results for trace level, naturally occurring elements (As, Ba, U) further demonstrate the use of this system to sample for low level groundwater contamination. © 2016, National Ground Water Association","40","Recharging (underground waters)","Aquifers - Groundwater - Groundwater pollution - Groundwater resources - Probes - Quality control - Trace elements - Uranium - Water quality","Correlation coefficient - Electrical conductivity - Ground water recharge - Groundwater contamination - Groundwater monitoring - High vertical resolution - Specific conductance - Unconsolidated formations",,"Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Up to now, indium tin oxide (ITO) films have been widely used as transparent conductive electrodes (TCE) in organic opto-electronic devices. However, ITO films, typically deposited on glass are brittle and they make it difficult to produce flexible devices, restricting their use for flexible devices. In this study, we report on a nano-composite TCE, which is made of a silver nanowire (AgNW) network, combined with aluminum-doped zinc oxide (ZnO:Al, AZO) by atomic layer deposition. The AgNWs/AZO composite electrode on photopolymer substrate shows a low sheet resistance of only 8.6 Ω/sq and a high optical transmittance of about 83% at 550 nm. These values are even comparable to conventional ITO on glass. In addition, the electrodes also have a very smooth surface (0.31 nm root-mean-square roughness), which is flat enough to contact the OLED stack. Flexible OLED were built with AgNWs/AZO electrodes, which suggests that this approach can replace conventional ITO TCEs in organic electronic devices in the future. © 2017, The Author(s).","28","Electron devices","Aluminum - Aluminum coatings - Atomic layer deposition - Conductive films - Current density - Deposition - Electric resistance measurement - Electrodes - Electronic equipment - Glass - ITO glass - Light emission - Nanocomposites - Nanowires - Optical films - Optoelectronic devices - Oxide films - Quantum efficiency - Silver - Thermoelectric equipment - Tin oxides - Zinc oxide","Al-doped ZnO - Aluminum-doped zinc oxide - Flexible organic light emitting devices - Organic electronic devices - Organic light-emitting devices - Root mean square roughness - Silver nanowires - Transparent conductive electrodes","541.1 AluminumAluminum - 547.1 Precious MetalsPrecious Metals - 615.4 Thermoelectric EnergyThermoelectric Energy - 701.1 Electricity: Basic Concepts and PhenomenaElectricity: Basic Concepts and Phenomena - 708.2 Conducting MaterialsConducting Materials - 741.1 Light/OpticsLight/Optics - 741.3 Optical Devices and SystemsOptical Devices and Systems - 761 NanotechnologyNanotechnology - 802.3 Chemical OperationsChemical Operations - 804.2 Inorganic CompoundsInorganic Compounds - 812.3 GlassGlass - 813.1 Coating TechniquesCoating Techniques - 813.2 Coating MaterialsCoating Materials - 931.4 Quantum Theory; Quantum MechanicsQuantum Theory; Quantum Mechanics - 933 Solid State PhysicsSolid State Physics - 933.1.2 Crystal GrowthCrystal Growth - 942.2 Electric Variables MeasurementsElectric Variables Measurements","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The influences of the different sealing layers added in the coatings on the microstructure, surface roughness, and corrosion behaviors were investigated. The results indicated that the sealing layer added by ALD significantly decreased the average grain size and improved the corrosion resistance of the CrN coatings.

This work modified the surface of the TNTAs/QDs photoelectrodes with metal-oxide overlayers by atomic layer deposition (ALD), such as coating Al2O3, TiO2, and ZnO. The ALD deposition of all these overlayers can apparently enhance the photoelectrochemical performance of the TNTAs/QDs. Under simulated solar illumination, the maximum photocurrent densities of the TNTAs/QDs with 10 cycles ZnO, 25 cycles TiO2, and 30 cycles Al2O3overlayers are 5.0, 4.3, and 5.6 mA/cm2at 1.0 V (vs. SCE), respectively.

Systematic examination of the effects of various metal-oxide overlayers on the photoelectrochemical performance indicates that the enhancement by TiO2and ZnO overcoatings can only ascribed to the decrease of the interfacial charge transfer impedance, besides which Al2O3coating can passivate the surface states and facilitate the charge transfer kinetics.

In addition, the influence of vertical electric field on the electronic band structures of the systems was carefully examined. Analyzing the adsorption energies of transition metals given by the PBE calculations, we found that the benzene molecule stabilized the binding of Cr and Mn on the MoS2surface, but destabilized the Fe binding by approximately 33% of adsorption energy. The attachment of benzene caused modifications on the total magnetizations of the Cr-MoS2and Mn-MoS2structures. The Bz-Mn@MoS2structure was found to exhibit half-metallicity with 100% spin polarization at the Fermi level.

The response of the liquid crystal to competing surface orientations, typical of patterned substrates, is determined by the anisotropy of the elastic constants and the interplay of the relevant lengths scales, such as the correlation length and the surface geometrical parameters. Transitions between different textures, usually with different symmetries, may occur under a wide range of conditions. We use the Landau-de Gennes free energy to investigate the texture of nematics in sinusoidal channels with parallel anchoring bounded by nematic-air interfaces that favour perpendicular (hometropic) anchoring. In micron size channels 5CB was observed to exhibit a non-trivial texture characterized by a disclination line, within the channel, which is broken into a zigzag pattern. Our calculations reveal that when the elastic anisotropy of the nematic does not favour twist distortions the defect is a straight disclination line that runs along the channel, which breaks into a zigzag pattern with a characteristic period, when the twist elastic constant becomes sufficiently small when compared to the splay and bend constants. The transition occurs through a twist instability that drives the defect line to rotate from its original position. The interplay between the energetically favourable twist distortions that induce the defect rotation and the liquid crystal anchoring at the surfaces leads to the zigzag pattern. We investigate in detail the dependence of the periodicity of the zigzag pattern on the geometrical parameters of the sinusoidal channels, which in line with the experimental results is found to be non-linear. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.","25","Nematic liquid crystals","Anisotropy - Crystal defects - Crystal orientation - Elastic constants - Free energy - Geometry - Liquid crystals - Liquids","Correlation lengths - Elastic instabilities - Landau-de Gennes free energy - Patterned substrates - Sinusoidal channels - Surface orientation - Topological defect - Twist elastic constant","641.1 ThermodynamicsThermodynamics - 921 MathematicsMathematics - 931.2 Physical Properties of Gases, Liquids and SolidsPhysical Properties of Gases, Liquids and Solids - 933.1.1 Crystal LatticeCrystal Lattice","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The particles were powdered using a freeze-dry method and dispersed in poly(vinyl chloride) by melt blending. Dynamic mechanical analysis indicated that the non-crosslinked particles were completely compatible. In contrast, mutual diffusion of the polymer chains in the crosslinked particles was restricted within the particle/matrix interfacial layer. As a result, an incompatible phase structure in which the crosslinked particles were dispersed in the continuous phase was formed. Pulse NMR analysis indicated that the interfacial layer thickness was in the range of 17–98 nm. The thickness decreased with an increase in the degree of crosslinking in the particles. The interfacial layer thickness in the particles was approximately 10 times larger than that for the incompatible polymer pair.

Therefore, authors of this paper carried out a comparative analysis of TiO2layers produced both using chemical (ALD) and electrochemical (anodic oxidation) methods. The study was performed based on evaluation of electrochemical properties of produced TiO2 layer on the Ti6Al7Nb substrate alloy. As a part of electrochemical properties testing, potentiodynamic, potentiostatic and impedance studies were performed.

The data set presented in this study represents the first complete237Np vertical profiles (0.12–0.27 μBq L− 1), and constitutes a baseline measurement to assess future changes. A similar behavior of Cs and Np has been evidenced, confirming that Np behaves conservatively. While the137Cs decrease has been driven by its radioactive decay, the vertical distribution of237Np has not substantially changed over the last decade. In the absence of recent major inputs, a homogenization of their vertical distribution occurred, partly due to deep convection events that became more intense during the last decade. In contrast,239+240Pu surface levels in the NW Mediterranean waters have fallen in the past four decades by a factor of 5. This decrease in surface has been balanced by higher concentrations in the deep-water layers. A first estimate of the downward239+240Pu fluxes in the NW Mediterranean Sea is proposed over more than two decades. This estimation, based on the DYFAMED sediment trap time-series data and published239+240Pu flux measurements, suggests that sinking particles have accounted for 60–90% of the upper layer (0–200 m) Pu inventory loss over the period 1989–2013. The upper layer residence time of Pu is estimated to be ~ 28 years, twice as long as the residence time estimated for the whole western Mediterranean (~ 15 years). This difference highlights the slow removal of Pu in the open waters of the NW Mediterranean and confirms that most of the Pu removal occurs along the coastal margin where sedimentation rates are high. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","93","Residence time distribution","Nuclear fuels","DYFAMED - Marine tracer - Northwestern Mediterranean - Plutonium isotopes - Vertical exports","922.1 Probability TheoryProbability Theory","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Emulsions were subsequently screened against several challenge pathogens to evaluate antimicrobial efficacy. Based on these time-kill assays, exemplary formulations were further tested as sanitizing washes on lettuce and blueberries inoculated with food-borne bacterial biofilms.

The diagnosis of the different types of neoplasia is made by a specialist through the analysis of histological images. However, these analyses are complex and the same case can lead to different understandings among pathologists, due to the exhaustive analysis of decisions, the time required and the presence of complex histological features. In this context, computational algorithms can be applied as tools to aid specialists through the application of segmentation methods to identify regions of interest that are essential for lymphomas diagnosis. In this paper, an unsupervised method for segmentation of nuclear components of neoplastic cells is proposed to analyze histological images of lymphoma stained with hematoxylin-eosin. The proposed method is based on the association among histogram equalization, Gaussian filter, fuzzy 3-partition entropy, genetic algorithm, morphological techniques and the valley-emphasis method in order to analyze neoplastic nuclear components, improve the contrast and illumination conditions, remove noise, split overlapping cells and refine contours. The results were evaluated through comparisons with those provided by a specialist and techniques available in the literature considering the metrics of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and variation of information. The mean value of accuracy for the proposed method was 81.48%. Although the method obtained sensitivity rates between 41% and 51%, the accuracy values showed relevance when compared to those provided by other studies. Therefore, the novelties presented here may already encourage new studies with a more comprehensive overview of lymphoma segmentation. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","83","Image segmentation","Diseases - Entropy - Fuzzy filters - Genetic algorithms - Image analysis - Object recognition - Oncology - Sensitivity analysis","Computational algorithm - Fuzzy 3-partition - Histological images - Illumination conditions - Lymphoma - Unsupervised segmentation - Valley-emphasis - Variation of informations","461.6 Medicine and PharmacologyMedicine and Pharmacology - 641.1 ThermodynamicsThermodynamics - 723 Computer Software, Data Handling and ApplicationsComputer Software, Data Handling and Applications - 921 MathematicsMathematics","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

With the continual development of information, communication, and sensor technologies, Condition-Based Maintenance (CBM) policies have gained popularity in industries. A successfully implemented CBM reduces the losses due to equipment failure by intelligently maintaining the equipment before catastrophic failures occur. However, effective CBM requires an effective fault analysis method based on gathered sensor data.

One of the important factors influencing the stability of a bacterial structure but also important in the context of an infection is the adhesion force. In order to model the sticking process over time, two theoretical models for bacteria are presented. These models allow to simulate the sticking process numerically. As the model complexity, may affect the calculation time, in this paper we derive two theoretical models of different complexity. One is a simple, adhesive viscous elastic, the other a more complex adhesive viscous elastic-plastic model. Both models can be applied to the simulation of the dynamics of bacteria. Thereby forces act when the bacterium is at a distance to a surface as well as during its contact. The attractive force is described by the van der Waals force by applying an adhesive-dissipative model. For the description of the bacterium within a liquid medium electrostatic double-layer and steric force models are additionally considered. In the attractive-dissipative sticking process viscous damping forces were considered, which results in the theoretically expected load-unload behaviour. The sticking process of a bacterium on a substrate is solved by applying the discrete element method. The bacterium addressed is S. aureus; while as substrate glass is considered. The parameters needed for the numerical simulation of this bacterium are taken from published physical experiments performed with atomic force measurements.

A novel method of rolling bearings fault diagnosis based on variational mode decomposition is presented in this contribution. The rolling bearing fault signal calculating model of different location defect is established by failure mechanism analysis, and the simulation vibration signal of the proposed fault model is investigated by FFT and envelope analysis. A comparison has gone to evaluate the performance of bearing defect characteristic extraction for rolling bearings simulation signal by using VMD and EMD. The result of comparison verifies the VMD can accurately extract the principal mode of bearing fault signal, and it better than EMD in bearing defect characteristic extraction. The VMD is then applied to detect different location fault features for rolling bearings fault diagnosis via modeling simulation vibration signal and practical vibration signal.

During the GEOTRACES GA04S-MedSeA expedition in 2013 seawater was collected from 10 vertical profiles covering the principal sub–basins of the Mediterranean Sea. The main objective was to understand the distributions of236U and129I in relation to the water masses, and to constrain their sources in this region. The236U/238U atom ratios and the129I concentrations ranged from (710 ± 40) × 10− 12to (2220 ± 60) × 10− 12and from (4.0 ± 0.1) × 107to (13.8 ± 0.3) × 107 at·kg− 1, respectively. The results show that radionuclide–poor Atlantic Water is entering at the surface through the Strait of Gibraltar whereas comparably radionuclide-enriched Levantine Intermediate Water is sinking in the Eastern Basin and flowing westward at intermediate depths. Low radionuclide levels were found in the oldest water masses at about 1000–2000 m depth in the Eastern Basin. At greater depths, waters were relatively enriched in236U and129I due to dense water formation occurring in both, the Eastern and Western Basins. The inventories of236U and129I cannot be explained only by global fallout from atmospheric nuclear bomb testings carried out in the 1950s and 1960s. We estimate that the liquid input of236U from the nuclear reprocessing facility of Marcoule (France), via the Rhône river, was of the same order of magnitude than the contribution from global fallout, whereas liquid and gaseous releases of129I from Marcoule were up to two orders of magnitude higher than global fallout.

In this article, the authors report on ALE of Si, Ge, C, W, GaN, and SiO2using a directional (anisotropic) plasma-enhanced approach. The authors analyze these systems by defining an “ALE synergy” parameter which quantifies the degree to which a process approaches the ideal ALE regime. This parameter is inspired by the ion-neutral synergy concept introduced in the 1979 paper by Coburn and Winters [J. Appl. Phys. 50, 5 (1979)]. ALE synergy is related to the energetics of underlying surface interactions and is understood in terms of energy criteria for the energy barriers involved in the reactions. Synergistic behavior is observed for all of the systems studied, with each exhibiting behavior unique to the reactant-material combination. By systematically studying atomic layer etching of a group of materials, the authors show that ALE synergy scales with the surface binding energy of the bulk material. This insight explains why some materials are more or less amenable to the directional ALE approach. They conclude that ALE is both simpler to understand than conventional plasma etch processing and is applicable to metals, semiconductors, and dielectrics. © 2017 Author(s).","34","Etching","Atoms - Binding energy - Dielectric materials - Germanium","Atomic layer etching - Energy criterion - Material combination - Multistep process - Process approach - Surface binding energies - Ultrathin layers - Underlying surface","549.3 Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals Nonferrous Metals and Alloys excluding Alkali and Alkaline Earth Metals - 708.1 Dielectric MaterialsDielectric Materials - 801.4 Physical ChemistryPhysical Chemistry - 802.2 Chemical ReactionsChemical Reactions - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular PhysicsAtomic and Molecular Physics","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

Boiling histotripsy (BH) is applied for mechanical fragmentation of soft tissue into submicron fragments with limited temperature increase using the shock wave and cavitation effects of HIFU. Research on BH has been largely limited to ex vivo experiments. As a consequence, the in vivo pathology after BH treatment and the relation to preexistent tissue characteristics are not well understood. This study reports on in vivo MR guided BH treatment, either with 100 or 200 pulses per focal spot, in three different subcutaneous mouse tumor models: a soft-tissue melanoma (B16OVA), a compact growing thymoma (EL4), and a highly vascularized neuroblastoma (9464D). Extensive treatment evaluation was performed using MR imaging followed by histopathology 2 h after treatment. T2 weighted MRI allowed direct in vivo visualization of the BH lesions in all tumor models. The 100-pulse treated area in the B16OVA tumors was larger than the predicted treatment volume (500 ± 10%). For the more compact growing EL4 and 9464D tumors this was 95 ± 13% and 55 ± 33%, respectively. Histopathology after the 100-pulse treatment revealed completely disintegrated lesions in the treated area with sharp borders in the compact EL4 and 9464D tumors, while for B16OVA tumors the lesion contained a mixture of discohesive (partly viable) clusters of cells, micro-vessel remainings, and tumor cell debris. The treatment of B16OVA with 200 pulses increased the fragmentation of tumor tissue. In all tumor types only micro-hemorrhages were detected after ablation (slightly higher after 200-pulse treatment for the highly vascularized 9464D tumors). Collagen staining revealed that the collagen fibers were to a greater or lesser extent still intact and partly clotted together near the lesion border in all tumor models. In conclusion, this study reveals effective mechanical fragmentation of different tumor types using BH without major hemorrhages. However, treatment settings may need to be adjusted to the tissue characteristics for optimal tissue fragmentation. © 2017","40","Tumors","Ablation - Collagen - Magnetic resonance imaging - Shock waves - Tissue","After-treatment - Cavitation effect - High intensity focused ultrasound - T2-weighted mris - Temperature increase - Tissue characteristics - Treatment volumes - Tumor ablation","461.2 Biological Materials and Tissue EngineeringBiological Materials and Tissue Engineering - 641.2 Heat TransferHeat Transfer - 746 Imaging TechniquesImaging Techniques - 931 Classical Physics; Quantum Theory; RelativityClassical Physics; Quantum Theory; Relativity","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

The PbSe films were oxidized at 380°C for 30 min and then iodinated at different iodine vapor pressures at 380°C for 5 min. When the iodine vapor pressure was below 20 Pa, PbSeO3 was the main phase formed on the surface of PbSe microcrystals for both undoped and iodine-doped films.

During steam treatment, pyrolysis products appear to have restrained molecular motions of the steam-heated bamboo, while cleavage of lignin increased molecular motion of the OCH3group. Bamboo treated with pressurized steam retained its hemicellulose and produced a smaller amount of pyrolysis products, while both hemicellulose and lignin were reduced by treatment with NaOH solution.

Among these demands is the frequent need to simultaneously etch features with a wide variety of aspect ratios (AR) on the same wafer. Many plasma etching processes exhibit aspect ratio dependent etching (ARDE) - different etch rates for features that have different aspect ratios, usually slower for larger AR. Processes subject to ARDE require over-etch to clear the larger AR features, which increases the need for high selectivity and low damage. Despite these issues, the physical processes which contribute to ARDE are not well understood. In this paper, results are discussed from a computational investigation on the root causes of ARDE during Ar/Cl2plasma etching of Si, and, in particular, the role which neutral transport plays in this process. Parametric studies were performed varying neutral-to-ion flux ratios, surface recombination rates of atomic Cl, and neutral and ion angular distributions to determine their influence on neutral transport of Cl to the etch front and ARDE. It was found that each parameter has a significant influence on neutral transport to the etch front (with the exception of the ion angular distribution). Methods for increasing neutral flux (for a given set of ion fluxes) to the etch front were found to push the system toward a neutral saturated, ion starved regime which alleviates ARDE for some range of AR. Increased neutral flux is also correlated with more tapered features, which tend to exhibit more significant ARDE. This coupling of neutral transport with feature profiles makes it difficult to alleviate all ARDE in this system. However, it is possible to optimize parameters in such a way to postpone the onset of ARDE to fairly large AR (>8). © 2017 American Vacuum Society.","45","Aspect ratio","Alpha particles - Angular distribution - Ions - Plasma etching - Semiconductor device structures - Semiconductor devices - Silicon wafers","Aspect ratio dependent etchings - Computational investigation - Ion angular distribution - Neutral transport - Plasma etching process - Surface recombinations - Three dimensional (3D) structures - Unprecedented demand","714.2 Semiconductor Devices and Integrated CircuitsSemiconductor Devices and Integrated Circuits - 802.2 Chemical ReactionsChemical Reactions - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular PhysicsAtomic and Molecular Physics","Compendex","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Engineering Village"

In this area, spatial variability of arsenic is high, peaking at 241 μg/L. Forty-seven percent of samples collected contained arsenic above the maximum allowable concentration for drinking water (10 μg/L). Correlations of As with other hydrochemical variables were investigated using multivariate statistical analysis (Hierarchical Cluster Analysis, HCA and Principal Component Analysis, PCA). It was found that As, V, Cr and pH are closely related and that there were also close correlations with temperature and Na+. The highest concentrations of arsenic and other associated Potentially Toxic Geogenic Trace Elements (PTGTE) are linked to alkaline NaHCO3waters (pH ≈ 9), moderate oxic conditions and temperatures of around 18 °C–19 °C. The most plausible hypothesis to explain the high arsenic concentrations is the contribution of deeper regional flows with a significant hydrothermal component (cold-hydrothermal waters), flowing through faults in the basement rock. Water mixing and water-rock interactions occur both in the fissured aquifer media (igneous and metasedimentary bedrock) and in the sedimentary environment of the CDB, where agricultural pollution phenomena are also active. A combination of multivariate statistical tools and hydrochemical analysis enabled the distribution pattern of dissolved As and other PTGTE in groundwaters in the study area to be interpreted, and their most likely origin to be established.
